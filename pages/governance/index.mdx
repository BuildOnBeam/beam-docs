# Governance

In the Beam ecosystem, governance comes in different forms. BEAM is required to participate in BEAM governance. Governance of the Beam Network will, after the [Horizon upgrade](/token/horizon), be conducted in a permissionless manner by validators of the Beam Network. When referring to governance in the context of blockchains, however, one usually refers to using a token - here BEAM - to vote on decisions about the future of one or more protocols. In that regard, BEAM governance can be divided into two main categories:

1. BEAM governance where a governance decision may result in the upgrades of, or changes to, Beam protocols.

1. BEAM governance where a governance decision is enforceable against Beam DAO-adjacent entities that, through their governing documents, are made compatible with BEAM governance.

BEAM may also be used for voting on matters where the outcome of a governance decision would not be enforceable. While being non-binding, such votes may be used to gauge the sentiment of the Beam community related to different topics and matters.

Even though BEAM governance is an important element of the Beam ecosystem, most activities related to the Beam ecosystem do not require a governance decision. Anyone can contribute to developing the Beam ecosystem or building within it, including to deploy game-related blockchain assets to the Beam Network in a permissionless manner.
