# Participate in BEAM Governance discussions

The [Beam Governance Forum](https://gov.onbeam.com) is the place where BEAM governance discussions will mainly be taking place. The Beam Governance Forum serves as a collaborative space for discussions and contributions that drive the development of the Beam ecosystem, including the Beam Network, other Beam protocols and the BEAM token. Here, the Beam community is invited to take part in shaping the future of the Beam ecosystem.

The platform consists of a number of categories that encompass a broad range of Beam related topics. Each category has a pinned 'About' post that provides further information about its purpose. The 'Latest' tab will show you the most recent conversations.

If you are new to the Beam Governance Forum, you may join the discussions by doing the following:

- **Create your profile**: Complete your profile setup with an avatar and a concise biography detailing your expertise and interests.

- **Review existing discussions**: Familiarize yourself with the Beam Governance Forum by browsing through threads that interest you. This will give you insight into ongoing discussions and areas of focus within the community.

- **Contribute thoughtfully**: Engage with the community through posts and responses. Note that a user must hold no less than 25,000 BEAM to post a thread in the proposal category, and that any other interaction (such as posting a thread in another category or a comment in any category) requires at least 1 BEAM.

- **Read about the governance process**: To learn more about the governance process, you can read the [Beam Governance Constitution](https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/governance/blob/f6cb77130fae81a268439d7686bf72a194582425/constitution/Beam%20Governance%20Constitution%20(Stamped).pdf).
