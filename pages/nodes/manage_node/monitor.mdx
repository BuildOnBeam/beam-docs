# Monitoring Your Node

If you want to inspect the process of L1 syncing, you can use the RPC call `platform.getBlockchainStatus`:

```bash /2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/ copy
curl -X POST --data '{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": "platform.getBlockchainStatus",
"params":{
"blockchainID":"2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn"
},
"id": 1
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/P
```

To check if your node is ready to be added as a validator, you can use the RPC call `info.isBootstrapped`:

```bash /2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/ copy
curl -X POST --data '{ 
  "jsonrpc":"2.0", 
  "id":1, 
  "method": "info.isBootstrapped", 
  "params": {"chain":"2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn"}
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

Refer to the [API docs](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/p-chain/api#platformgetblockchainstatus) for a response explanation.

To gain deeper insights into your L1, examine the blockchain log. Normally, you can find this log in `~/.avalanchego/logs/ChainID.log{:bash}`. Just replace `ChainID` with the real ID of your blockchain in your L1.

Beam Mainnet example logfile location:
`~/.avalanchego/logs/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn.log{:bash}`

To better understand how your Node and the L1 are working, you can set up a tool called Prometheus+Grafana. This tool helps you monitor their performance and comes with easy-to-read charts for regular operations and specific L1 data. There's a [step-by-step guide](https://build.avax.network/docs/nodes/maintain/monitoring) available to help you get it all set up.
