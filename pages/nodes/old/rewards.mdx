# Beam Node Rewards

The Beam Network is a vital part of the Beam ecosystem which stretches far and wide throughout the gaming industry with a suite of smart contracts, decentralized applications, games and other activities. Those that empower and secure the Beam Network, and thereby contribute to a decentralized gaming future, may receive a wide variety of network rewards in return.

These rewards can be divided into primary and secondary rewards. It's important to note that the exact calculations of the rewards will constantly change, and are, among other things, dependent on the total number of active validators, Node Tokens staked and BEAM staked.

## Primary rewards

The primary rewards consist of the transaction (gas) fees on the Beam Network. These transactions are settled in the network's native currency, BEAM, and will be paid out in BEAM directly to active validators and BEAM delegators based on their respective portion of staked BEAM.

The distribution of the primary rewards will be handled through a formula that considers the total number of active validators, BEAM staked and the total transaction volume on the Beam Network.

## Secondary rewards

To further reward those who help empower and secure the Beam Network and ecosystem, secondary rewards will be introduced. This reward structure is unlike any other and consists of the following:

-   Protocol fees generated across the Beam ecosystem, including:
-   Swap Fees from BeamSwap.
-   Bridge Fees from Beam Bridge.
-   Marketplace Fees from Sphere.
-   Other integrated Beam protocols, to the extent applicable.
-   Validator incentive grants by Beam Foundation, from its [Treasury](https://treasury.onbeam.com), which will include (a) tokens such as $ATH, $ZENT, $SAGA, $TON and more, (b) contributions from [Beam Ventures](https://medium.com/@onbeam/beam-ventures-to-launch-as-the-first-gaming-fund-in-abu-dhabi-051a9dea3353) and (c) contributions from [Tactical Compute](https://medium.com/@onbeam/beam-foundation-aethir-and-metastreet-unite-to-launch-tactical-compute-a-40m-ai-compute-2f3bd1488eec).

Similar to the primary rewards, these secondary rewards will flow autonomously to the validators and delegators. 80% of the secondary rewards will flow to validators and delegators staking Node Tokens (based on their respective portion of staked Node Tokens) and 20% of the secondary rewards will flow to validators and delegators staking BEAM (based on their respective portion of staked BEAM).

The total secondary rewards will be determined based on a variety of factors:

-   The number of Node Tokens staked.
-   The number of BEAM staked.
-   The total amount of fees collected from Beam protocols.
-   The fees that are distributed through validator incentive grants.
-   The total amount of sponsored rewards contributed by Beam Foundation through the validator incentive grant.
-   The commission fee charged to delegators.
-   The time Node Tokens or BEAM remain staked during each epoch.
-   Slashing of rewards.    

  

More details about the calculation and distribution of rewards (both primary and secondary) will be provided as the nodes become operational in Q1, 2025.
