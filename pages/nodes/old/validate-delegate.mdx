# Differences Between Validator and Delegator

The core distinctions between validators and delegators are outlined below:

|                      | Validator                                                                                                                                                                                           | Delegator                                                                                 |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibilities     | Actively run a node, validate transactions, and participate in securing the Beam Network.                                                                                                           | Entrust tokens to a validator to participate in network security indirectly.              |
| Stake Requirement    | Minimum stake of 20,000 BEAM and 1 Node Token (ERC-721).<br/><br/> Must pay a 1.33 AVAX/month fee (currently subsidized by BEAM grants and subject to reduction via Avalanche Community Proposals). | Minimum stake of 1 BEAM token and/or 1 Node Token.                                        |
| Infrastructure       | Must maintain 99%+ uptime to avoid slashing, achievable through services like NaaS (Node-as-a-Service), VPS, or dedicated hardware (meeting system requirements).                                   | No infrastructure responsibilities.                                                       |
| Rewards Distribution | Receive rewards directly for validation efforts. Validators can set their own commission rates for sharing rewards with delegators.                                                                 | Receive rewards indirectly as a share of the validator's earned rewards after commission. |
