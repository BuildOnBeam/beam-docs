# Delegation

Delegation allows users to contribute to the Beam Network's security and decentralization without running a validator node. By delegating their BEAM tokens or Node Tokens, users support validators in processing transactions and maintaining the network.

## How Delegation Works

Delegators can stake their BEAM and/or Node Tokens with validators operating Beam Nodes. While they don't run a node themselves, delegators play an essential role in securing the network and enabling its decentralized functionality. Delegators may in return earn rewards. 

## Key Details
- **No Minimum Delegation**: Delegators can stake any amount of BEAM and/or Node Tokens, even as little as 1 token.
- **Withdrawal Period**: Delegated BEAM or Node Tokens are subject to a **21-day waiting period** before they can be undelegated.
- **Rewards**: Delegators earn rewards proportional to their stake from both primary rewards (transaction fees) and secondary rewards (protocol fees and Validator Incentive Grants).
- **Commission Fees**: Validators can set a commission fee on the rewards earned by their delegators, which varies by validator.

## Delegation Rewards

Delegators receive rewards from two primary sources:

- **[Primary rewards](/pages/nodes/rewards/primary)**: Transaction fees (gas fees) on the Beam Network, distributed in BEAM.
- **[Secondary Rewards](/pages/nodes/rewards/secondary)**: These include protocol fees (e.g., from BeamSwap and Sphere marketplace) and grants from Beam Foundation Treasury, which may consist of additional tokens and contributions.

### Reward distribution
- **80%** of secondary rewards flow to Node Token stakers (validators and delegators).
- **20%** of secondary rewards flow to BEAM stakers (validators and delegators).

## Slashing Risks
While delegation is a simpler way to support the network, delegators are not exempt from risks. If a validator is penalized for poor uptime, malicious activity, or misbehavior, their delegators will also face **slashing penalties**, losing part of their rewards.
