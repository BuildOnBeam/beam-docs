# Beam Node Rewards

The Beam Network is a vital part of the Beam ecosystem which stretches far and wide throughout the gaming industry with a suite of smart contracts, decentralized applications, games and other activities. Those that empower and secure the Beam Network, and thereby contribute to a decentralized gaming future, may receive a wide variety of network rewards in return.

These rewards can be divided into [primary](/nodes/rewards/primary) and [secondary](/nodes/rewards/primary) rewards. It's important to note that the exact calculations of the rewards will constantly change, and are, among other things, dependent on the total number of active validators, Node Tokens staked and BEAM staked.
