# How to delegate Node Tokens

Go to the Delegation dashboard and view the list of [active validators](https://beam-nodes-delegation-git-ui-add-chain-info-onbeam.vercel.app/delegations)

You can use the filtering and sorting options if you wish to find specific validators or narrow down the search.

1. Choose a validator running a Beam Node that aligns with your goals.
2. Delegate your Node Tokens to the selected validator.

3. Monitor validator performance to ensure consistent rewards and minimal slashing risks.
