# How to delegate Node Tokens

This page describes how you can stake your Node tokens with validators by using the Delegation dashboard.

Go to the Delegation dashboard and view the list of [active validators](https://nodes.onbeam.com).

You can use the filtering and sorting options if you wish to find specific validators or narrow down the search.

1. Choose a validator running a Beam Node that aligns with your goals.
2. Delegate your Node Tokens to the selected validator.
