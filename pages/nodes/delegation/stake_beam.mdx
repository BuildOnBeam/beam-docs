# How to stake BEAM

This page describes how you can stake your BEAM with validators by using the Delegation dashboard.

Go to the Delegation dashboard and view the list of [active validators](https://nodes.onbeam.com).

You can use the filtering and sorting options if you wish to find specific validators or narrow down the search.

1. Choose a validator running a Beam Node that aligns with your goals.
2. Stake your BEAM to the selected validator.
