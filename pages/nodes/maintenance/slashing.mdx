# Slashing
The moment a validator cannot guarantee enough uptime, or the other validators in the network earmark a certain validator as malicious or dishonest (misbehaving), that particular Beam Node will lose (a part of) its rewards, and those delegating to this node will get slashed on their respective rewards.

The most important metric is validator uptime, which must be equal to or above 80% of the given epoch to receive full rewards. If uptime drops below 80%, rewards for that epoch drop in a linear fashion.
