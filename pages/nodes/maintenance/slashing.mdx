# Slashing
The moment a validator cannot guarantee enough uptime, or the other validators in the network earmark a certain validator as malicious or dishonest (misbehaving), that particular Beam Node will lose (a part of) its rewards, and those delegating to this node will get slashed on their respective rewards.

The most important metric is validator uptime, measured over the entire epoch. Validators must achieve at least 80% uptime within the epoch to receive full rewards. If uptime falls below 80%, rewards are scaled linearly based on the percentage of the epoch served.
