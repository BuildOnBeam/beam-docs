# Node-as-a-Service (NaaS)

In case you do not feel comfortable operating a validator node yourself, you may consider using a node-as-a-service (NaaS) provider to validate on your behalf. This option of staking requires a level of trust in the NaaS provider. Normally, the user does not have to give up access to the keys that allow for withdrawing or transferring staked funds.

See below a list of NaaS providers on the Beam Network. Note that the service providers are listed for the convenience of the Beam community and that this should not be taken as an endorsement or recommendation to use any of them.
