## Method 1: Setting up your own Avalanchego node

## Installing AvalancheGo

The first step to running a Beam Node is installing AvalancheGo, the client for the Avalanche network. The easiest method is using the installer which you can find [here](https://build.avax.network/docs/nodes/using-install-script/installing-avalanche-go). Please note that this guide is compatible with AvalancheGo version 1.14.0.

## Installing the Beam Network-EVM

<Steps>

### Downloading the Subnet-EVM

First, download the Subnet-EVM binary from [Ava-Labs GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) and copy it into the AvalancheGo plugin directory.

```bash
mkdir subnetevm
cd subnetevm
wget https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/download/v0.8.0/subnet-evm_0.8.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf subnet-evm_0.8.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
cp subnet-evm ~/.avalanchego/plugins/kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz
```

<Callout type="info">
  Please ensure you have downloaded the latest compatible [Subnet-EVM
  release](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases).
</Callout>

The long string `kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz` is the CB58 encoded VMID of the Beam Subnet-EVM. AvalancheGo will use the name of this file to determine what VMs are available to run from the plugins directory.

### Tracking the Beam L1, configuring Partial Network Sync

To start tracking the Beam L1, update your node config in your preferred editor.

<Callout type="info">
  The installation script creates the node configuration file at
  `~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json`. If AvalancheGo is built from source, no
  default file is created; you would need to create it manually if needed.
</Callout>

```bash
nano ~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json
```

Add the `track-subnets` option to node config and set `partial-sync-primary-network`. By default, an AvalancheGo node syncs all chains, including the C-Chain and X-Chain. This setting ensures that only the necessary network components are synchronized, reducing resource usage and improving node startup times.

```json
{
  "track-subnets": "eYwmVU67LmSfZb1RwqCMhBYkFyG8ftxn6jAwqzFmxC9STBWLC",
  "partial-sync-primary-network": true
}
```

As an alternative to the config file, you can pass the subnet ID as parameter during the node start-up:
```bash
--track-subnets eYwmVU67LmSfZb1RwqCMhBYkFyG8ftxn6jAwqzFmxC9STBWLC
```

### Apply Network Upgrades

Create the config directory for Beam and download the `upgrade.json` file from GitHub. Place it in the appropriate directory.

You might need to use `sudo` to elevate your privileges if `mkdir` fails. If you don't have `wget` on your particular Linux distribution, you can use the `curl -O` command instead.

```bash copy
mkdir -p ~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn
cd ~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-subnet/main/subnets/beam-mainnet/upgrade.json
```

If you didn't use the installer, your config directory may be located elsewhere. In that case, place the file in `{chain-config-dir}/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/`, where `2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn` is the `{blockchainID}`.


### Restarting the Node

After updating your configuration, restart your node to begin tracking the Beam L1.

```bash copy
sudo systemctl restart avalanchego
```

</Steps>

Once your Beam Node is properly set up, head over to [register a validator](/nodes/run_node/register).
