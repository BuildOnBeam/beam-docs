# Installation Methods

Beam Nodes became available following the completion of the Horizon upgrade. There are various ways to install a Validator Node, of which the two recommended methods are covered below.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation of the Validator Node, please ensure you have:

- Sufficient storage space for blockchain data
- Reliable internet connection
- Basic command line knowledge

## Method 1: Setting up your own Avalanchego node

## Installing AvalancheGo

The first step to running a Beam Node is installing AvalancheGo, the client for the Avalanche network. The easiest method is using the installer which you can find [here](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/install/avalanchego-installer). Please note that this guide is compatible with AvalancheGo version 1.12.2.

## Installing the Beam Subnet-EVM

<Steps>
### Downloading the Subnet-EVM

First, download the Subnet-EVM binary from [Ava-Labs GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) and copy it into the AvalancheGo plugin directory.

```bash
mkdir subnetevm
cd subnetevm
wget https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/download/v0.7.1/subnet-evm_0.7.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf subnet-evm_0.7.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
cp subnet-evm ~/.avalanchego/plugins/kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz
```

<Callout type="info">
  Please ensure you have downloaded the latest [Subnet-EVM
  release](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases).
</Callout>

The long string `kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz` is the CB58 encoded VMID of the Beam Subnet-EVM. AvalancheGo will use the name of this file to determine what VMs are available to run from the plugins directory.

### Tracking the Beam L1

To start tracking the Beam L1, update your node config in your preferred editor.

<Callout type="info">
  The installation script creates the node configuration file at
  `~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json`. If AvalancheGo is built from source, no
  default file is created; you would need to create it manually if needed.
</Callout>

```bash
nano ~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json
```

Add the `track-subnets` option to node config:

```json
{
  "track-subnets": "eYwmVU67LmSfZb1RwqCMhBYkFyG8ftxn6jAwqzFmxC9STBWLC"
}
```

As an alternative to the config file, you can pass the subnet ID as parameter during the node start-up:
```bash
--track-subnets eYwmVU67LmSfZb1RwqCMhBYkFyG8ftxn6jAwqzFmxC9STBWLC
```
</Steps>

## Method 2: Setting up an Avalanchego node via Docker

### Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your system

### Prepare Docker image

Head over to: https://build.avax.network/tools/l1-toolbox#avalanchegoDocker

This website is an app that will help you pre-configure a Docker container that runs your node against a specific network (as specified by the Subnet ID). 

Make sure to input the correct L1 subnet ID in the textbox: "eYwmVU67LmSfZb1RwqCMhBYkFyG8ftxn6jAwqzFmxC9STBWLC". Once done, copy the code from the "Node Command" field and paste it into your command line terminal.

Example code:
```
docker run -it -d \
    --name avago \
    -p 127.0.0.1:9650:9650 -p 9651:9651 \
    -v ~/.avalanchego:/root/.avalanchego \
    -e AVAGO_PARTIAL_SYNC_PRIMARY_NETWORK=true \
    -e AVAGO_PUBLIC_IP_RESOLUTION_SERVICE=opendns \
    -e AVAGO_PLUGIN_DIR=/avalanchego/build/plugins/ \
    -e AVAGO_HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
    -e AVAGO_TRACK_SUBNETS=eYwmVU67LmSfZb1RwqCMhBYkFyG8ftxn6jAwqzFmxC9STBWLC \
    -e AVAGO_NETWORK_ID=fuji \
    avaplatform/subnet-evm:v0.7.1
```
If the container is running successfully, it's time to move onto the next step: #run_node/register.mdx
