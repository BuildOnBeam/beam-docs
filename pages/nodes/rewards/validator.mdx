# Validator Incentive Grant

The Validator Incentive Grant is a mechanism designed to incentivize validators to participate in the Beam Network. It is a mechanism that allows validators to receive rewards from the Beam Foundation's Treasury. These rewards are distributed to validators and delegators based on their respective portion of staked Node Tokens.

## Seasons

Rewards of the Validator Incentive Grant are distributed in 4 seasons, representing the 4 quarters of the year. With each sesason, we're determining the amount of rewards that will be distributed to the validators and delegators.
