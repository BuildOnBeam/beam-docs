# Secondary rewards

To further reward those who help empower and secure the Beam Network and ecosystem, secondary rewards will be introduced. This reward structure is unlike any other and consists of the following:

-   Protocol fees generated across the Beam ecosystem, including:
-   Swap Fees from BeamSwap.
-   Bridge Fees from Beam Bridge.
-   Marketplace Fees from Sphere.
-   Other integrated Beam protocols, to the extent applicable.
-   Validator incentive grants by Beam Foundation, from its [Treasury](https://treasury.onbeam.com), which will include (a) tokens such as $ATH, $ZENT, $SAGA, $TON and more, (b) contributions from [Beam Ventures](https://medium.com/@onbeam/beam-ventures-to-launch-as-the-first-gaming-fund-in-abu-dhabi-051a9dea3353) and (c) contributions from [Tactical Compute](https://medium.com/@onbeam/beam-foundation-aethir-and-metastreet-unite-to-launch-tactical-compute-a-40m-ai-compute-2f3bd1488eec).

Similar to the primary rewards, these secondary rewards will flow autonomously to the validators and delegators. 80% of the secondary rewards will flow to validators and delegators staking Node Tokens (based on their respective portion of staked Node Tokens) and 20% of the secondary rewards will flow to validators and delegators staking BEAM (based on their respective portion of staked BEAM).

The total secondary rewards will be determined based on a variety of factors:

-   The number of Node Tokens staked.
-   The number of BEAM staked.
-   The total amount of fees collected from Beam protocols.
-   The fees that are distributed through validator incentive grants.
-   The commission fee charged to delegators.
-   The time Node Tokens or BEAM remain staked during each season.
-   Slashing of rewards.
