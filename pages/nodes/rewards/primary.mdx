# Primary rewards

The primary rewards consist of the transaction (gas) fees on the Beam Network. These transactions are settled in the network's native currency, BEAM, and will be paid out in BEAM directly to active validators and BEAM delegators based on their respective portion of staked BEAM.

The distribution of the primary rewards will be handled through a formula that considers the total number of active validators, BEAM staked and the total transaction volume on the Beam Network.
