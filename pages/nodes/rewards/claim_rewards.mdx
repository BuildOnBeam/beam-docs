# How to claim rewards

Pending rewards can be claimed through the Delegation dashboard. Once you sign in with your wallet which was used to create delegations or set up your validator node, you will be able to access the Rewards sub-page from this page: https://beam-nodes-delegation-git-ui-add-chain-info-onbeam.vercel.app/delegations

In the rewards page, you will see your personalized list of pending rewards. Each reward will be claimable individually and will trigger an on-chain transaction for you to approve before receiving your rewards.
