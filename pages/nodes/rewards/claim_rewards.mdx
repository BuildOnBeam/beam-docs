# How to claim rewards

**Disclaimer:** rewards are not claimable at this point but will be soon with an upcoming update to the dashboard!

Pending rewards can be claimed through the Delegation dashboard. Once you sign in with your wallet which was used to create delegations or set up your validator node, you will be able to access the Rewards sub-page from this page: https://beam-nodes-delegation-git-ui-add-chain-info-onbeam.vercel.app/delegations

[TODO: Add image of Rewards link]

In the rewards page, you will see your personalized list of pending rewards. Each reward will be claimable individually and will trigger an on-chain transaction for you to approve before receiving your rewards.
