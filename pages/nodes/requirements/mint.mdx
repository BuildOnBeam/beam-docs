# How to mint a Node Token?

Below we have displayed a step-by-step process for minting a Node Token via [nodes.onbeam.com](https://nodes.onbeam.com/mint).

As the source code of the smart contract is open source, note however that others may also implement a user interface (frontend) to interact with such a smart contract. It will also be possible to interact with the smart contract directly by other means. Consequently, it is possible to interact with the smart contract elsewhere than by use of nodes.onbeam.com if a user wishes to do so.

---

### Step 1 - Head over to [nodes.onbeam.com](https://nodes.onbeam.com/mint)

The first step to take is to ensure you have accessed the correct site. As described above, in principle anyone can implement a user interface to interact with the smart contract, but if you wish to use [nodes.onbeam.com](https://nodes.onbeam.com/mint), make sure that you are on the correct site. Please only trust the official links shared by the [Beam Foundation](http://x.com/beamfdn) and [BuildOnBeam](http://x.com/buildonbeam) accounts.

### Step 2 - Connect your wallet

In the upper right corner, press 'connect wallet'. This will open up a pop-up where you may select the wallet of your preference. This ranges from MetaMask, Phantom, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet to virtually any supported wallet.

---

### Step 3 - Press 'mint node token'

Once you've successfully connected your wallet, it's time to initiate the minting process. This is done by pressing the 'mint node token' button in the middle of your screen.

### Step 4 - Select your preferences

In a new popup window, you will be met with a variety of choices to make:


-   Chain - historically Node Tokens were available on several chains. Since we're past the Horizon Upgrade, only Beam Network is available.

-   Amount - decide how many Node Tokens you wish to mint.

-   Referral code - if applicable, you can enter a referral code here.



Once you've made your decisions, press the 'increase allowance' button to allow your wallet to interact with the contracts. Verify this action in your chosen wallet.

### Step 5 - Mint

After you've given approval, the final step is pressing the 'mint' button. This action once again needs to be approved and confirmed on your wallet of choice. After confirmation on the blockchain, the minted token will be available in your wallet.
