# Bridging Funds to Beam Network

Users may bridge tokens to the Beam Network by using any bridge protocols deployed on Beam Network. 

Below we have displayed a step-by-step process for bridging tokens by use of Beam Bridge. As the Beam Network is a permissionless blockchain network, note that anyone may deploy a bridge protocol on it and develop interfaces that interact with it.

Follow these steps to bridge your tokens to the Beam Network using the Beam Bridge.

<Steps>

### Visit the Beam Bridge

Navigate to the [Beam Bridge](https://bridge.onbeam.com) in your web browser.
