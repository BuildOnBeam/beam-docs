# Beam Nodes

The Horizon upgrade has transformed the Beam Network into a permissionless, proof-of-stake Layer 1 blockchain that anyone can help secure and validate. Beam Nodes form the backbone of this decentralized network infrastructure, processing transactions and adding new blocks to the Beam Network. Whereas previously, true decentralization through validation was limited by the hefty price tag, the Horizon upgrade has made the network more accessible.

## What are Beam Nodes?
Beam Nodes are validator nodes that operate on the Beam Network following the Horizon upgrade. These nodes:

- Process transactions on the Beam Network
- Validate and add new blocks to the blockchain
- Ensure data availability and network security
- Operate within a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism

## Key requirements
To run a Beam Node, validators must:
- Stake at least 1 Node Token (ERC-721)
- Stake at least 20,000 BEAM
- Meet the hardware requirements
- Pay the continuous fee mechanism in AVAX to Avalanche P-Chain validators

## How to participate
You can participate in the Beam Network's validation in two ways:

- As a validator – Run your own Beam Node, meeting all requirements and directly processing transactions.
- As a delegator – Stake your BEAM and/or Node Tokens to validators without running node software yourself.
