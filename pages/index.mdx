## Overview


```typescript
import { Beam } from '@onbeam/node';
 
const beam = new Beam('x-api-key');

const profile = await beam.profiles.createProfile('profileID');

const profiles =  await beam.profiles.getAllProfiles({
  offset: 0,
  limit: 10
});
```

In this example, we initialize an instance of Beam by passing your api key. We then proceed to create a Profile. A Profile is the Beam entity you'll be mostly interacting with.

Each profile automatically gets assigned a wallet on the Beam blockchain.


### Managing assets

Profiles are custodial, and through your api key you are able to transfer / trade and manage assets of the profiles of your users - for as long as the users are custodial. In late 2023, we're aiming to release a feature for users to take self-custody of their accounts, but you'll be in control of implementing the feature to allow them to take custody.

```typescript
import { Beam } from '@onbeam/node';
 
const beam = new Beam('x-api-key');

const transfer = await beam.assets.transfer({
  sender: 'ProfileID-A',
  receiver: 'ProfileID-B',
  assetAddress: '0x0',
  tokenId: 23
})
```
