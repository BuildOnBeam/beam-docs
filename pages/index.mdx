Welcome to the Beam technical documentation hub. Whether you are a blockchain enthusiast, a developer, or someone new to the world of blockchain, you will here find a treasure trove of resources relating to the Beam network and other parts of the Beam ecosystem.

The Beam ecosystem is a network of technologies, projects, communities, organizations and persons, utilizing, relying on, securing, or developing the Beam network, Beam protocols and their related smart contracts. This includes any Beam users and gamers, Beam validators, BEAM tokenholders, Beam infra providers and Beam developers. In the center of this vertically integrated ecosystem, is the BEAM token, fuelling its existence and activities.

Beam network is an open-source sovereign blockchain network focused on gaming, that is permissionless and open to everyone. Using the Avalanche tech stack, Beam network operates independently to cater towards gamers and game developers.
