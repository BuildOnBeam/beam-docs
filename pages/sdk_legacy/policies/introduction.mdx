# Introduction to Policies

Policies are the means to make Profiles pay for transactions in an on-chain, in-game ERC20 token - but not necessarily the native one. If your game supports an in-game ERC20 token - let's call them Gold - and you would like to charge your user an X amount of Gold for every on-chain transaction you facilitate, Policies are the feature you're looking for.

A policy is nothing else than a simple set of rules, which you can reference in every transaction that you make - the rules you define are up to you.
