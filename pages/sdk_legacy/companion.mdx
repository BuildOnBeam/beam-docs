  Make sure you connect to **Beam testnet** in order to implement the application

### Connecting users to the Beam Companion app

The Beam Companion app works based on the same authentication solution as is being used in the self-custody features of Beam, meaning that any user you onboard through that solution will automatically be linked to your game and is able to use the Beam Companion app.
