# Introduction to the Automation API

Through the Automation API, you're able to create [Profiles](/sdk/profiles/introduction) to control assets and distribute them to your users.

### What is the managed service?

The managed service in Beam is, in technical design, very similar to our [self-custody](/sdk/introduction-player-api) solution. The key difference is that the managed services are exactly what the name says - they are managed, by us (and yourself). Through the `Secret` API key, you will be able to create [Profiles](/sdk/profiles/introduction) and manage assets accordingly.

### Disclaimer

It's important to understand that the managed service and its features are **not meant to be used to control user assets**. If you are looking to implement parts of our service to do that, please refer to our [self-custody](/sdk/introduction-player-api) solution.

### Getting started with self custody

- [Profiles](/sdk/profiles/introduction): Understand the role of Profiles as your players' on-chain inventories and more.
- [Policies](/sdk/policies/introduction): Understanding and creating policies.
- [Trading](/sdk/trading/introduction): Trade assets and tokens between two profiles securely.
