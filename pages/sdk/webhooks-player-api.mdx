### User Connection

We support webhooks for game connection events. This allows you to be notified when a player connects to your game.
In order to set it up, go to Dashboard -> Your game -> Edit game info -> User connection webhook URL.

Setup a reachable URL to your service, which will receive a POST request with the following payload:

```json
{
  "requestId": "cluci3tgv00005nfiyy5fc7ak",
  "entityId": "yourEntityId",
  "userId": "cluwlv3xv0000ue8nas5opvhr",
  "connectedAt": "2025-03-19T11:44:33.911Z",
}
```

We will call it once for every user that finished Game Connection flow initiated by your game. This includes connecting user to your game via first [session](/sdk/sessions/introduction) Flow.
We expect any response code from [200, 201, 202, 204], in case of any other code or timeout, we will retry 3 times, with 30 seconds delay after each attempt.

Webhook will be called for every entityId user connects with.
