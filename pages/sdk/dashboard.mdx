# Introduction to Beam Dasboard

The [Beam Dashboard](https://dashboard.onbeam.com) allows you to manage your game information, assets, API keys and network funds through a website instead of directly interacting with the API.

For information on what you can customize and what assets to provide, visit the following pages:

- [API keys](/sdk/game/api-keys): API keys and how to invalidate them

- [Managing contracts](/sdk/game/managing-contracts): Add and remove asset contracts to your game

- [Updating your game](/sdk/game/updating-game): Update information (name, visuals) of your game
