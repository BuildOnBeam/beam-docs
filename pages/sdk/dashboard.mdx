# Beam Dashboard

To get started with your implementation on the Beam Network, we've created the [Beam Dashboard](https://dashboard.testnet.onbeam.com). The Beam Dashboard allows you to manage your game, contracts, API keys, and network funds through a web app.

Are you ready to release your game on mainnet? You'll need to register your game on the [mainnet Beam Dashboard](https://dashboard.onbeam.com).

### Registering your game 

When registering your game, we will ask you for a bunch of information — don't worry, you'll be able to change the information you add here at any point in time.

Take into account that some of the information you provide here is external-facing: various details, like the name of your game and the imagery you add, will be used in in-game flows provided through our SDKs.

### API keys

After you've registered your game on the Beam Dashboard, you will be presented with two API keys:

- The Publishable key - this key can be used in both server-side and client environments.
- The Secret key - this key allows you to read and manage data; please only use it in a secure environment.

These API keys will help you get started, but make sure you store the secret key well — we only show it once.

### Imagery

Throughout various interfaces, we'll want to show you a few visuals related to your game. To do this, we currently allow you to store three different images, each with its own purpose.

- **Game logo (`logoImageUrl`)** (1:1 ratio, e.g., 320x320)
  - Used on the game detail page on top of the background image and as a reference to the game in the asset overview. Since we use this layered on top of the background image, we recommend you use an image that contains the logo with a transparent background.
  - Used on Beam Identity when signing transactions and setting the "hide popups" expiration.
- **Game banner (`coverImageUrl`)** (recommended 16:9 ratio, e.g., 1280x720)
  - Used on the game card in the overview interface of the companion app.
- **Game header background (`backgroundImageUrl`)** (recommended 16:9 ratio, e.g., 1280x720)
  - Used on the game detail page as a background image for the header. We advise you not to put text in this image.
