### Custom charges of in-game currencies (coming soon)

Another â€” and probably the most interesting option for most developers - is charging in-game (ERC20) tokens as a form of payment for transactions. To easily explain the flexibility this gives you, let's assume you have an in-game token called 'Gold'. Users obtain Gold either through playing your game, or by making an in-app purchase, and you would like to charge users their Gold when you handle a transaction for them.

### Creating a custom charge policy

You could charge your users an X amount of Gold by simply creating a policy, and providing the `policyId` any transaction. When this happens, the in-game Gold will be taken away from the user, while under the hood we use BEAM to run a transaction.

### Economic viability

Eventually, you as a game developer will be responsible for funding the BEAM for all the transactions that are ran through our service, so if you take away in-game Gold, you have to consider if it is economically viable to make this transaction. Let's assume a single transaction on Beam costs < 0.001 BEAM, and a Gold costs the user $ 0.05 to obtain - this means that the transaction through the policy is now not only economically viable, it also allows you to to sponsor quite some transactions for the user as the single Gold paid for the transaction in tenfold.

```typescript
const transaction = await beam.assetsV2.transferAssetV2("your-sender-id", {
  assets: [
    receiverEntityId: "your-receiver-id",
    assetAddress: "your-contract-address",
    assetId: "73",
    amountToTransfer: 1,
  ]
  // ...
  sponsor: false, // ðŸ‘ˆ This handles the transaction to be self paid
  policyId: "cl..", // ðŸ‘ˆ This triggers the custom policy to be used
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }
```
