# Supported currencies in Beam Marketplace

At the moment of writing the Beam marketplace supports a couple of pre-configured tokens for all marketplace interactions. In order to get the currencies supported for a specific chain, we've added a method. Here's how you can use it:

```typescript
const currencies = await beam.marketplace.getChainCurrencies(4337); // the chain ID you want to get the supported currencies for

// {
//   data: [
//     {
//       currency: 'USDC'
//       decimals: 18,
//       address: '0x007Fdc86FD12924C9116025C7F594843087397E3'
//     }
//   ]
// }
```

## Supporting in-game currencies

Depending on your needs, we're able to add additional ERC-20 tokens that are also registered for your game on Beam, allowing you to interact with the Marketplace based on your own in-game currency. However, do keep in mind that if you list assets in your own currency on Sphere, you probably also want to consider adding a liquidity pool on the Beam Swap in order to facilitate users who might not be playing your game yet, but are still interested in obtaining one of it's assets through the marketplace.

## Requesting your token to be added

Currently, adding a currency to Beam marketplace requires us to take a couple of manual steps. If you're interested in adding your token, contact the team through Slack, Telegram or build@onbeam.com
