# Introduction to the Marketplace

In order to get an in-game marketplace set up, we offer various methods that can help you get started with listing assets.

Before creating a full marketplace integration it is important to understand all of the possibilities that you have. Here are some articles to get you started:

- [Currencies](currencies): Supported currencies in Beam marketplace

- [Create a listing](listing-assets): Listing an asset for sale

- [Buying a listed item](buying-assets): Buying a listed asset through Sphere through the SDK

- [Offers](offers): Allow profiles to create offers on listed and unlisted assets

### Roadmap

Throughout the coming months, we'll be releasing additional features that will help you provide a more complete marketplace experience, with features ranging from programmatic offers, auctions and extensive filtering options to allow you to create a full-fledged in-game marketplace solely by relying on the Beam marketplace.
