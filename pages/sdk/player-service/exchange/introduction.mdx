# Introduction to the Exchange

The API allows you to convert any in-game tokens or BEAM associated with a profile, using Beam's decentralized exchange available at [Beam App](https://app.onbeam.com/swap). Conversion rates are determined via an Automated Market Maker mechanism, and depend on supply and demand of the respective tokens. You can learn more about setting up a liquidity pool for your own tokens [here](https://swap.onbeam.com/#/pool), in order to enable trading.
