# Introduction to the Exchange

The API allows you to convert any in-game tokens or BEAM associated with a profile, using Beam's decentralized exchange available at (https://app.onbeam.com)[https://app.onbeam.com]. Conversion rates are determined via an Automated Market Maker mechanism, and depend on supply and demand of the respective tokens. You can learn more about setting up a liquidity pool for your own tokens here, in order to enable trading.
