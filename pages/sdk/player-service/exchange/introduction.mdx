# Introduction to the Exchange

The API allows you to convert any in-game tokens or BEAM associated with a profile, using Beam's **decentralized exchange** [swap.onbeam.com](https://swap.onbeam.com).
Conversion rates are determined via an _Automated Market Maker_ mechanism, and depend on supply and demand of the respective tokens.
You can learn more about setting up a _liquidity pool_ for your own tokens [here](https://docs.onbeam.com/chain/beam-ecosystem/amm#how-do-i-provide-liquidity), in order to enable trading.
