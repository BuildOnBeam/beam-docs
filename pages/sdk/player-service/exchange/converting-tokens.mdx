title: Programmatic decentralized token conversion on Beam

# Converting tokens

The API allows you to convert any in-game tokens or BEAM associated with a profile, using Beam's **decentralized exchange** [swap.onbeam.com](https://swap.onbeam.com).
Conversion rates are determined via an _Automated Market Maker_ mechanism, and depend on supply and demand of the respective tokens.
You can learn more about setting up a _liquidity pool_ for your own tokens [here](https://docs.onbeam.com/chain/beam-ecosystem/amm#how-do-i-provide-liquidity), in order to enable trading.

## General flow

In general, swapping tokens via the API always follows the same process - fetching the price for the conversion, and then executing the swap.
This two-step process serves as an important safeguard against overpaying, as exchange prices fluctuate.

To obtain prices, you'd pass in to the API:

- The contract addresses of the desired _input_ and _output_ tokens
  - The _zero address_ (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) can be used to refer to BEAM tokens
- An amount to swap, either a desired _input_ and _output_ token amount

Depending on the "direction" of the conversion, there are two different use cases, which are covered with examples below too.
Let's assume we have two tokens _IN_ and _OUT_:

- The player wants to swap 100 IN to OUT
  - We first need to get the amount of OUT we can expect to get for 100 IN
  - Then convert it with an **exact _input_ swap** to make sure we get the highest amount of OUT for our 100 IN
- The player wants to buy 10 OUT
  - Here we first fetch the required amount of IN to obtain 10 OUT
  - Then convert it with an **exact _output_ swap** to make sure get exactly 10 OUT

## Converting with an exact input amount

We assume our player owns 1000 in-game tokens, and wants to convert them on the spot to BEAM tokens.
We first need to get a quote and see how much BEAM we'd get by calling `getQuoteForOutput`, and passing in our _input_ amount of 1000.

```typescript
const quoteOutput = await beam.exchange.getQuoteForOutput(
  "0x008518e76FAD03f592Bbb7E394C762d5FD54cb97", // input token address
  "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // output token address, 0x0... refers to native BEAM (gas token)
  "1000" // input token amount to swap
);

// {
//   "tokenIn": "0x008518e76FAD03f592Bbb7E394C762d5FD54cb97",
//   "tokenOut": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
//   "amountIn": "1000",
//   "amountOut": "10.1"
// }
```

In this case we can expect to get 10.1 BEAM for 1000 of our tokens.
If the player is happy with the result, we execute the swap by simply passing in the result of the previous
call to `convertInputs`, which makes sure we spend _exactly_ 1000 in-game tokens, and receive _at least_ 10.1 BEAM.

```typescript
const swapTransaction = await beam.exchange.convertInput(
  "entity-id",
  quoteOutput
);

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }
```

## Converting with an exact output amount

In this example, the player wants to buy exactly 10 jewel tokens, using some of their in-game tokens.
To determine the price the player has to pay, we call `getQuoteForInput` with the desired _output_ amount of 10.

```typescript
const quoteInput = await beam.exchange.getQuoteForInput(
  "0x008518e76FAD03f592Bbb7E394C762d5FD54cb97", // input token address
  "0xF65B6f9c94187276C7d91F4F74134751d248bFeA", // output token address, "jewel token"
  "10" // desired output token amount
);

// {
//   "tokenIn": "0x008518e76FAD03f592Bbb7E394C762d5FD54cb97",
//   "tokenOut": "0xF65B6f9c94187276C7d91F4F74134751d248bFeA",
//   "amountIn": "42.1",
//   "amountOut": "10"
// }
```

Calling `convertOutput` with the result above makes sure we spend _a maximum_ of 42.1 in-game tokens, and receive _exactly_ 10 jewels.

```typescript
const swapTransaction = await beam.exchange.convertOutput(
  "entity-id",
  quoteInput
);

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }
```
