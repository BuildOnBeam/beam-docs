### User Connection

We support webhooks for game connection events. This allows you to be notified when a player connects to your game.
In order to set it up, go to Dashboard -> Your game -> Edit game info -> User connection webhook URL.

Setup a reachable URL to your service, which will receive a POST request with the following payload:

```json
{
    "gameId": "cltr7dre601ahakla28hbtuim",
    "requestId": "cm8pw6v2i013ow203htb794ic", // optional when coming from Session flow
    "entityId": "yourPlayerEntityId",
    "authProvider": "Google", // any of ["Any", "Google", "Apple", "Discord"]
    "user": {
        "id": "cm0y2wsnk01il820ubo0qo8lb",
        "wallets": [
            {
                "chainId": 13337,
                "address": "0x5fDf55d9b88e0d52bD710aA2CB76434e0d6A20c7"
            },
            {
                "chainId": 531050104,
                "address": "0x956e21658e3B356C8F88aE3D5163cBb5Bc3Eef3a"
            }
        ]
    },
    "connectedAt": "2025-03-26T12:19:51.116Z"
}
```

We will call it once for every user that finished Game Connection flow initiated by your game. This includes connecting user to your game via first [session](sessions/introduction) Flow.
We expect any response code from [200, 201, 202, 204], in case of any other code or timeout, we will retry 3 times, with 30 seconds delay after each attempt.

Webhook will be called for every new entityId user connects with.
`requestId` property is optional and related to Connection Request started from SDKs. When connecting User to your game through first Session flow, this value will not be included.
