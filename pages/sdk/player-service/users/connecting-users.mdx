# Connecting users to your game

In order to use the Player API, you need to connect your users to your game. This is done by creating a new user in the Player Service. The user will be created with a unique identifier, which can be used to reference the user in future API calls, similarly to Automation Service, you will refer to this user through an `EntityId`. This can be any identifier you want, as long as it's unique within your game registration. You can assign users multiple entityIds and in some cases, user will be automatically assigned an entityId that is his Externally Owned Account address.


In order connect a user to your game, you can either start the Connection flow using one of our [Platform clients](../../index) or the [Player API](../api/api-reference) directly.

### Connecting users using the Connect To Game flow
When using our [Platform clients](../../index) it's fairly easy to connect users.
In case of Unity client, all you need to do is to call an awaitable method called `ConnectUserToGame`. This method will take care of opening the browser for you on most platforms. You can read more about this in [BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unity](https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unity).

<Tabs items={["Unity", "cURL"]}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```csharp
        var result = await beamClient.ConnectUserToGameAsyncV2("EntityId"); // will also work without entityId
        if (result.Status == BeamResultType.Success)
        {
            var user = await beamClient.UsersApi.GetUserAsync(result.Result.EntityId);
            // you can now perform Operations with this User
        }
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```curl
        curl -X 'POST' \
            'https://api.beta.onbeam.com/v1/connection/request' \
            -H 'accept: application/json' \
            -H 'x-api-key: your-publishable-api-key' \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d '{
            "entityId": "yourEntityId"
        }'


        // response:
        // {
        //     "id": "cmanzaozv014iyu01aob3jf6l",
        //     "status": "Pending",
        //     "authProvider": "Any",
        //     "createdAt": "2025-05-14T12:34:41.804Z",
        //     "updatedAt": null,
        //     "entityId": "yourEntityId",
        //     "gameId": "clxb647kh015rs3igxsmwri27",
        //     "url": "(...)" - this is the URL you need to open in the browser
        // }
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

After opening resulting `url`, user needs to sign in using one of the supported Social Login options and will see this screen:
<img src="/assets/connecting_user/connecting-user.png" alt="Connecting users to your game" width="400px" />

Afterward you can initialize Operations and send assets to your user, using his `EntityId`. If you decide to not use `EntityId`, users EOA address will be assigned automatically instead and returned in the result.

### Connecting users using first Session signing

To make things even more friction-less for players, we also connect them to your game when you initiate [Session](../sessions/introduction) signing flow. This reduces amount of interruptions from the game to an absolute minimum.

```csharp
 var activeSessionResult = await beamClient.CreateSessionAsync(EntityId);
if (activeSessionResult.Status == BeamResultType.Success)
{
    var session = activeSessionResult.Result;
    // you can now sign Operations without leaving the game
}
```

### Connection webhooks
You can get notified if a Game Connection was made by a User. For this, we have introduced [User connection webhook](../player-webhooks).
