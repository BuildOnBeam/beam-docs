# Introduction to Sessions

A self-custody implementation for your users means that the ownership of the account abstraction used, is **owned** by the private key in control of the user. Every time you want to interact with the blockchain on the users' behalf, you will need to ask them to sign a transaction.

This experience can be troublesome and cause interruptions - both for you as the developer and for the gamer. In order to minimize the friction involved, we offer Sessions.


### What is a session?

A session is, in essence, a **temporary authorized and limited-in-scope** private key, that can sign transactions on behalf of the self-custodial account abstraction for your users.

While this sounds intimidating, we created a useful abstraction in our Platform SDKs that allow you to generate a session, and ask the user to authorize those sessions through a web interface.
