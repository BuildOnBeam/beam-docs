## Managing imagery

In the Beam Companion app, we'll want to show you a few visuals related to your game. In order to do this we currently allow you to store three different images, each with their own purpose.

- **game logo (`logoImageUrl`)** (1:1 ratio, eg; 320x320)
  - Used on the game detail page on top of the background image, and as a reference to the game in the asset overview. Since we use this layered on top of the background image. We recommend you to use an image that contains the logo with a transparent background.
  - Used on Beam Identity when signing transactions and setting the "hide popups" expiration.
- **game banner (`coverImageUrl`)**: (recommended 16:9 ratio, eg; 1280x720)
  - Used on the game card in the overview interface of the companion app.
- **game header background (`backgroundImageUrl`)** (recommended 16:9 ratio, eg; 1280x720)
  - Used on the game detail page as a background image for the header. We advice you to not put text in this image.
