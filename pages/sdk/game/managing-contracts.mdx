## Managing contracts

If you want to run transactions for profiles that interact with specific contracts, the contract address will need to be registered for your game.

We provide a method for you to add any contract to your game, as long as you can provide us with the ABI and contract address. As adding a contract address to your game is probably a one time action that you won't repeat (a lot) over time, we can also recommend simply interacting with the hosted [Swagger UI](https://api.testnet.onbeam.com/api/automation) to simply add the necessary contracts to your game.

### Companion app

If you're using the [Beam Companion](/sdk/companion/introduction) app, it might be good to know that as soon as you add a contract to your game, all connected users to profiles of your game are able to see said contract in the [Beam Companion](/sdk/companion/introduction) app.

### Adding a contract

Adding a contract is as simple as calling the `addContractToGame` method.

```typescript
import { Beam } from "@onbeam/automation-api-client";

const beam = new Beam("x-api-key");

const contract = beam.game.addContractToGame({
  address: "string", // the deployed contract address
  type: "ERC20", // ERC721, ERC1155
  chainId: 13337, // 13337 for Beam testnet
  name: "string", // The name of the asset contract, for example: 'Card Packs'

  // the JSON abi for the contract, we recommend you grabbing it from the explorer if you have a deployed & verified contract
  abi: [
    {
      name: "string",
      type: "string",
      anonymous: true,
      payable: true,
      constant: true,
      stateMutability: "string",
      gas: "string",
      inputs: [
        {
          name: "string",
          type: "string",
          indexed: true,
          internalType: "string",
          components: ["string"],
        },
      ],
      outputs: ["string"],
    },
  ],
});

// {
//  "type": "ERC20",
//  "id": "string",
//  "createdAt": "string",
//  "updatedAt": "string",
//  "externalId": "string",
//  "address": "string",
//  "name": "string",
//  "chainId": 0,
//  "gameId": "string"
//}
```

### Deleting a contract

Removing a contract from your game is just as simple, simply use the `removeContractFromGame` method to remove it.

```typescript
import { Beam } from "@onbeam/automation-api-client";

const beam = new Beam("x-api-key");

const contract = beam.game.removeContractFromGame({
  address: "string", // the deployed contract address
  chainId: 13337, // 13337 for Beam testnet
});

// {
//  "success": true
//}
```
