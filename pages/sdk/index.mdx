# Getting started

Getting started with your implementation on the Beam Network is easy. To make it simple, we've created a self-service dashboard to help you get started.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you would like advice or need help finding a strategy that suits your needs, please contact us at build@onbeam.com. We can provide help with bridging existing assets through LayerZero or provide you with complete and audited contracts to get your in-game assets going.

<Steps>
  ### Step 1 - Registering your game

  To get started, you can obtain your API key for Beam by registering your game on the [Beam Dashboard](/sdk/dashboard). The API keys you're able to obtain here are valid for the testnet version of the [Beam Network](/chain/get-started/rpc). Are you looking for a mainnet implementation? You might want to jump ahead to the [mainnet dashboard](https://dashboard.onbeam.com).

  You will need to authenticate with a social account and a wallet, which can be used later on to allow you to sponsor transactions for your players.

  ### Step 2 - Add your in-game contracts (optional)

  Once you've registered your game, it's possible to add contracts for in-game items and tokens. You will need to ensure the contract is verified on our [block explorer](https://subnets-test.avax.network/beam) before you add it to your game.

  If you don't have any contracts yet — don't worry! You're able to proceed from here but will need to add a contract later to interact with these assets in your game.

  ### Step 3 - Pick an implementation strategy

  We offer various ways to integrate your game on the Beam Network but highly recommend any new developer get started with our [Player API](/sdk/introduction-player-api), a service focused on facilitating a self-custodial implementation of Web3 in your game.

  Would you like to start right away? Jump ahead to [our SDKs](/sdk/implementation-player-api) for the [Unity](https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unity) and [Unreal](https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unreal) game engines.
