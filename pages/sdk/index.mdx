# Overview

Beam SDK is a term that wraps our entire set of tools that allow you to introduce NFTs and Blockchain integration into your game via user-friendly [Account Abstractions](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/). Your users can create on-chain Accounts without the friction that is usually associated with storing Private Keys and security concerns. With a few clicks players can create their self-custodial Beam Wallets using Social Login options like Google, Apple or Discord.

Through [Sessions](/sdk/player-service/sessions/introduction) and [Policies](/sdk/automation-service/policies/introduction), Beam SDK enables you to create a safe, frictionless experience for your players, allowing them to interact with Blockchain without dealing with on-chain transactions or worrying about transaction fees.

Let's take look at the parts of Beam SDK ecosystem:

### Beam App
The all-in-one application to manage your Beam Wallet. [Read more](/sdk/beam-app).

### Beam API
Set of APIs for managing different types of accounts.
You can use the API via one of our [HTTP Clients](/sdk/api/api-clients) or directly by referring to our [OpenApi schema](/sdk/api/api-reference)

##### Player API
A **self-custodial** service to implement Beam directly into your game with our game engine SDKs.

##### Automation API
A **custodial** service to implement distribution/automation in your backend services.

You can read more about differences between those in [Player or Automation Service](/sdk/beam-player-vs-automation).

### Beam Platform Clients
Set of SDKs to use within game engines like [Unreal](/sdk/platform-clients/unreal), [Unity](/sdk/platform-clients/unity) or a more generic [Web SDK](/sdk/platform-clients/web)

### Beam Dashboard
All-in-one dashboard to manage your game and its assets. You can register your game, add contracts, manage funds and API keys.

### Sphere
Sphere is the marketplace for games, the backbone of game developers to launch an in-game marketplace. [Read more](/sdk/sphere/introduction).
