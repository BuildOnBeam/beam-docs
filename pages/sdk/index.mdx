# Overview

Beam SDK is a term that wraps our entire set of tools that help you integrate the Beam Network into your game.
Our tools allow you to introduce NFTs and Blockchain integration into your game via user-friendly [Account Abstractions](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/). This way users can create on-chain Accounts without friction that is usually associated with storing Private Keys and security concerns. With few clicks your players can create their Beam Wallets using Social Login options like Google, Apple or Discord and then interact with Blockchain from within your game in a safe and friction-less way.

Beam introduces self-custodial Player API and Policies that allow you to fund your players transactions and manage their in-game assets, taking away the headache of paying transaction fees away from your users.
Through Sessions, you can provide a friction-less experience for your players, allowing them to interact with your game without worrying about signing on-chain transactions each time.

Let's take look at the parts of Beam SDK ecosystem:

### Beam App
The all-in-one application to manage your Beam Wallet. [Read more](/sdk/beam-app).

### Beam API
Set of APIs for managing different types of accounts.
You can use the API via one of our [HTTP Clients](/sdk/api/api-clients) or directly by referring to our [OpenApi schema](/sdk/api/api-reference)

##### Player API
A **self-custodial** service to implement Beam directly into your game with our game engine SDKs.

##### Automation API
A **custodial** service to implement distribution/automation in your backend services.

You can read more about differences between those in [Player or Automation Service](/sdk/beam-player-vs-automation).

### Beams Dashboard
All-in-one dashboard to manage your game and its assets. You can register your game, add contracts, manage funds and API keys.

### Beam in-game SDKs
Set of SDKs tu use within game engines like [Unreal](/sdk/ingame-sdks/unreal) or [Unity](/sdk/ingame-sdks/unity)

### Sphere
Sphere is the marketplace for games, the backbone of game developers to launch an in-game marketplace. [Read more](/sdk/sphere/introduction).
