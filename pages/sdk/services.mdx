# Beam Services

To provide game developers with an extensive toolset of options, our platform consists of two main services:

- **The Player API** - A **self-custodial** service to implement Beam directly into your game with our game engine SDKs.
- **The Automation API** - A **custodial** service to implement distribution/automation in your backend services.

Would you like to start right away? Jump ahead to [our SDKs](/sdk/implementation-player-api) for the [Unity](https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unity) and [Unreal](https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unreal) game engines.

### Player API

If you're looking to implement your game onto the Beam Network, we highly recommend you get started with our [Player API](/sdk/introduction-player-api). We offer multiple solutions to help you use our self-custodial Player API on both the server and client sides. Since the user controls the private key that owns the account we deploy, there is no doubt about who owns the assetâ€”the gamer.

- [Implementation](/sdk/implementation-player-api): How to get started.
- [Operations](/sdk/operations/introduction): An introduction to Operations.
- [Sessions](/sdk/sessions/introduction): An introduction to Sessions.
- [Transactions](/sdk/transactions/introduction): Understand how to run sponsored, self-paid, and custom charge transactions.
- [Assets](/sdk/assets/introduction): Simplify in-game asset management.
- [Marketplace](/sdk/marketplace/introduction): List, buy, and make offers on other people's assets.
- [Exchange](/sdk/exchange/introduction): Convert tokens based on configured liquidity pools.

### Automation API

While the [Player API](/sdk/introduction-player-api) offers everything needed to get you going, you might be interested in a programmatic solution for various back-end purposes. For example, if you're looking to create a programmatic minter that you can control through one of our clients, the Automation API is the one you're looking for.

- [Profiles](/sdk/profiles/introduction): Understanding Automation API wallets.
- [Policies](/sdk/policies/introduction): Understand and create policies.
- [Trading](/sdk/trading/introduction): Trade assets and tokens between two profiles securely.
