# Introduction to Sphere

Sphere is the marketplace for games, the backbone of game developers to launch an in-game marketplace.

### The only gaming marketplace you will ever need

As a marketplace, Sphere covers all the bases. First, it acts as an aggregator, presenting a huge range of assets from multiple games that users can search within and browse through — kind of a digital catalog. But Sphere also facilitates in-game marketplaces. Thanks to the [Beam SDK](/sdk/platform-clients/introduction), anyone who's building a game has the ability to spin up a marketplace within the game, where players can buy, sell and trade their assets. It all happens under the hood, so it doesn't disrupt the gamer's experience, and Sphere collects fees on each transaction.
