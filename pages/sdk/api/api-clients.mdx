# API Clients

We auto generate clients in few languages for our APIs to help you get started quickly.
We have separate clients available for both Automation and Player APIs.

#### Automation API clients

All Automation API clients are meant to be used  on the **server side**, as it is crucial to not expose any of the api keys we provided publicly. It's meant to be used with Secret API Key.

#### Player API clients

The Player API clients can be used in the client, as the Publishable API Key that is required to interact with the self-custody services can be exposed without risk.

If you want to use a different language, you can always use our [API Reference](/sdk/api/api-reference) to get started. The API is RESTful and you can use any HTTP client to make requests.
Just remember to pass your API key in the `x-api-key` header.
