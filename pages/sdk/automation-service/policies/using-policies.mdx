# Using policies

Once created, policies will only be used if you explicitly pass the Policy ID when running a transaction. The general rule of thumb is that the `policyId` property will be available on every method in our SDK if the method itself triggers an on-chain transaction.

```typescript
const transaction = await beam.assets.transferAsset("automation-profile-entity-id", {
  receiverEntityId: "receiving-user-entity-id",
  assetAddress: "your-contract-address",
  assetId: "73",
  // ...
  sponsor: false, // 👈 This handles the transaction to be self paid
  policyId: "cl..", // 👈 This triggers the custom policy to be used
});
```
