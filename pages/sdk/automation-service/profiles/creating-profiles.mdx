# Creating profiles

Creating a profile is as simple as calling the `CreateProfile` method. The only thing we require you to send us is a string that uniquely represents the player on your end. We call this your `entityId`, and you decide what this ID is.

```typescript
const profile = await beam.profiles.createProfile({ entityId: "some-string-unique-to-you", chainId: 4337 });
```

A couple of examples what this ID could contain:

- An ID representing an entity in your own service (for example: a match ID)
- A pre-defined constant, eg; 'Minter'

It's up to you! But consider this carefully: in case of an application emergency on your end, you will want to be able to restore a mapping to the correct Profiles, hence our recommendation using an identifier which you already have and can easily fetch.

The `entityId` you provide us with is included in most Profile related responses as the `externalEntityId`, should you ever need to refer to it.

## Profiles on chain

Note that the wallets we create do not exist on-chain until then first transaction finalizes. Once a profile is created, it will not be deployed until the first on-chain activity takes place.
