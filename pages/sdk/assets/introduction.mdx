# Introduction to Assets

Asset management is a crucial part of the Beam integration within your game. Depending on on-chain activities that you want to support in your in-game economy, you have the option to manage assets of the players you created, but also list - buy and make offers on assets through the Beam SDK. By nature of self custodial Player accounts, every most operations require the Player to sign the operation, either directly or via [Sessions](/sdk/sessions/introduction).

By providing these options through the sdk, you are able to create a frictionless in-game marketplace built on Beam without having to worry about creating infrastructure to support it.
