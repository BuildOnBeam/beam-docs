# Platform clients

Platform clients are libraries or plugins we created to make it easier for you to integrate Beam into your game. They are available for the most popular game engines and platforms, including Unity, Unreal Engine. We also offer Web SDK for web-based games and applications, which has an added benefit of being WAGMI compatible.

They all contain a built-in [Player API Client](./../api/api-clients) but most importantly, they allow you to easily introduce [Sessions](../player-service/sessions/introduction) and [Connect your users to your game](../player-service/users/connecting-users).
