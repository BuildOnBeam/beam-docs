# Unity SDK

We offer an SDK that allows you to easily integrate the Beam Network into your game. The SDK is designed to be easy to use and provides a wide range of features to help you get started quickly. It uses self-custodial Player Profiles.

### Installation
To install Beam SDK for Unity you have to add following dependencies:

#### Option 1 - manifest.json

Open Packages/manifest.json and add these lines:

```
"beam.sdk.client": "https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unity.git?path=/Unity",
"com.cysharp.unitask": "https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask"
```

#### Option 2 - Package Manager Editor UI

Follow these instructions:

https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html

And add these urls:
```
https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unity.git?path=/Unity
https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask.git?path=src/UniTask/Assets/Plugins/UniTask
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Note: using  `https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unity.git?path=/Unity` will always default to the newest version of the main branch. You probably should lock the url to particular release to avoid potential compatibility issues.
    To do so, add `#vX.X.X` to the url, like this: `https://github.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-sdk-unity.git?path=/Unity#v1.0.0`.

### Basic usage
You can just instantiate BeamClient from your GameObject and configure it via few methods:
```csharp
var beamClient = gameObject.AddComponent<BeamClient>()
                .SetBeamApiKey("your-publishable-api-key") // set your Publishable(!) API key
                .SetEnvironment(BeamEnvironment.Beta) // defaults to Beta
                .SetDebugLogging(true) // optional, defaults to false
                .SetStorage(yourCustomStorageImplementation); // optional, defaults to PlayerPrefs storage;
```
