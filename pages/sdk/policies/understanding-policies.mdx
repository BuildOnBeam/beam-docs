## Understanding Gas and Policies in EVM Blockchains

### Overview of Gas on EVM Blockchains
- **Gas Units**: A measure of computational effort required to execute transactions or smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **Gas Payment in Native Currency**: Each blockchain has its own native currency for gas payments. Examples include:
- Beam: Paid in Beam.
- Ethereum: Paid in Ether.
- Polygon: Paid in MATIC.

### Challenge: Users Lacking Native Currency
In scenarios where users need to transact but lack the native currency for gas, Beam 'policies' provide a solution, allowing for payments in a specific ERC20 token.

### Types of Policies for Transactions

#### 1. Fixed Charge Policies
**A set amount of the ERC20 token is charged per transaction, regardless of the gas cost.**
- **Economics**: While offering stable and predictable costs for users, this model can be financially risky for developers during high gas prices.
- **User**: Users benefit from a straightforward and predictable cost structure, making budgeting for transactions easier and transparent.
- **Example**: A transfer transaction might be set at 1 $Gold, while a minting transaction costs 10 $Gold. They will always cost the same, regardless of the gas price.

#### 2. Dynamic Charge Policies
**Charges in ERC20 tokens are calculated based on the current gas cost, the developer needs to set and exchange rate of ERC20 to wei in native currency.**
- **Economics**: Aligns transaction costs with real-time gas market prices, introducing variability in costs for the user.
- **User**: Users face fluctuating transaction costs, which can be challenging to predict and may require an understanding of gas market dynamics.
- **Example**:
- If the gas price is 20 gwei:
- Mint transaction: 100 gas units * 20 gwei = 2,000 wei (equivalent to 20,000 $Gold at an exchange rate of 10 $Gold per wei).
- Transfer transaction: 50 gas units * 20 gwei = 1,000 wei (equivalent to 10,000 $Gold).
- If the gas price is 10 gwei:
- Mint transaction: 100 gas units * 10 gwei = 1,000 wei (equivalent to 10,000 $Gold).
- Transfer transaction: 50 gas units * 10 gwei = 500 wei (equivalent to 5,000 $Gold).
- **Note**: Example calculations are for illustrative purposes and should be adapted for production use.

### Choosing Between Fixed and Dynamic Policies
Developers must weigh the benefits of simplicity (fixed policies) against the need for adaptability to market conditions (dynamic policies).
- **User Considerations**: Given that most users lack in-depth knowledge of gas mechanics, the responsibility of managing price volatility and associated risks ideally lies with the developers.
