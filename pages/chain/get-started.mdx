## Beam: The Gaming Network

Beam is more than a gaming blockchain; it's a community-driven platform where gamers and developers come together to shape the future of the gaming industry. Whether you're a developer looking to create the next breakthrough game or a player seeking the best blockchain gaming experience, Beam offers a powerful, flexible solution.

Momentarilly, Beam operates as an Avalanche subnet. In this role, Beam is not just an independent blockchain but is part of a vibrant, interconnected network. It benefits from the scale, speed, and security features of the Avalanche protocol, while also possessing the ability to operate individually with its specific focus on gaming applications. [Learn more](https://docs.avax.network/learn/avalanche/subnets-overview) about Avalanche Subnets.

In the developer preview mode, Beam employs a reputation-based consensus method termed Proof of Authority (PoA), enhanced with the Snowman protocol. This set-up entrusts a selected group of reputable authorities to authenticate transactions, thereby safeguarding the blockchain's integrity. The PoA model emphasizes the value of the validators' reputations, with these validators being handpicked based on their trustworthiness. This allows for a highly scalable system where blocks and transactions are verified by pre-approved participants acting as system moderators.

## The role of the Merit Circle DAO Token ($MC) 

To interact with Beam, $MC, the Merit Circle DAO token, is required. The Merit Circle Token is the native currency used within the Beam network to pay for transactions. This not only includes transfers of value but also involves all interactions with smart contracts on the Beam network, facilitating a seamless, immersive gaming experience.

## Building on Beam: Empowering Innovation

What sets Beam apart is its compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a highly advanced computational emulator that supports smart contract coding in Solidity. This cross-platform alignment allows developers to seamlessly port Ethereum-based applications onto Beam, opening a world of possibilities in building immersive, engaging games. If you've previously developed on Ethereum, you'll find the transition to Beam effortless.

As of now, Beam is a operating under a reputation-based consensus method termed Proof of Authority (PoA), implying that one needs to acquire specific rights to build on it. These rights are provided by a 4 out of 8 multi-signature spread across various contributors of the Merit Circle DAO. While this might seem restrictive at first glance, it is a strategic move to ensure quality and security, given that each entity on the network is verified and trusted. We understand that every new member brings unique potential and value to the Beam community. Therefore, we invite developers interested in contributing to the Beam network to reach out to us directly at hello@meritcircle.io
