# Differences Between Validator and Delegator

The core distinctions between validators and delegators are outlined below:

|                      | Validator                                                                                                     | Delegator                                                                                                                      |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Responsibilities     | Validators actively **run a node**, validate transactions, and actively participate in securing the network.  | Delegators **do not run a node** themselves but entrust their tokens to a validator to participate on their behalf.            |
| Stake Requirement    | Validators have a **higher minimum stake** requirement and, additionally, they have to **stake $AVAX tokens**. | The minimum stake **requirement** for delegators is **lower** and only requires $BEAM tokens.                                   |
| Rewards Distribution | Validators **receive rewards directly** for their validation efforts.                                         | Delegators **receive rewards indirectly** through the validator they delegate to, sharing a portion of the validator's reward. |
