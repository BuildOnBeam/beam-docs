# Differences Validator and Delegator
The main differences between validators and delegators are:

|    | Validator | Delegator |
| :----- | :---- | :---- |
| Responsibilities    |  Validators actively **run a node**, validate transactions, and actively participate in securing the network.   |   Delegators **do not run a node** themselves but entrust their tokens to a validator to participate on their behalf. |
| Stake Requirement | Validators have a **higher minimum stake** requirement and, additionally, they have to **stake AVAX tokens**.   |  The minimum stake **requirement** for delegators is **lower** and only requires MC tokens.  |
| Rewards Distribution | Validators **receive rewards directly** for their validation efforts.  |  Delegators **receive rewards indirectly** through the validator they delegate to, sharing a portion of the validator's reward. |
