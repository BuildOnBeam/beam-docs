# Beam Node

**tbd: All settings are for testnet, need to update with mainnet release**

To run your own Beam Node, no matter if you plan to run a validator node or a non-validating node, you have to install AvalancheGo. The easiest method is using the installer which you can find [here](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/build/set-up-node-with-installer).

Once you have a running AvalancheGo installation, you need to add the Beam Subnet-EVM to track the Beam Subnet in your node.


## Install Beam Subnet-EVM

<Steps>
### Download Subnet-EVM


First we have to download the Subnet-EVM binary from [Ava-Labs Github](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) and copy it into the AvalancheGo plugin directory. The plugin folder is the default folder when using the AvalancheGo Installer.

```bash /kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz/
mkdir subnetevm
cd subnetevm
wget https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/download/v0.5.3/subnet-evm_0.5.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf subnet-evm_0.5.3_linux_amd64.tar.gz
cp subnet-evm ~/.avalanchego/plugins/kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz
```

<Callout type="info">
  Please check if you download the latest [Subnet-EVM release](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases).
</Callout>

The long string `kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz` is the CB58 encoded VMID of the Beam Subnet-EVM. AvalancheGo will use the name of this file to determine what VMs are available to run from the plugins directory. 

### Track Beam Subnet

To start tracking the Beam Subnet update your node config in your favorite editor.

```bash copy
nano ~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json
```

Add the "`track-subnets`" option to node config. 
```json
{
	<OTHER-CONFIGURATIONS>
	"track-subnets": "ie1wUBR2bQDPkGCRf2CBVzmP55eSiyJsFYqeGXnTYt2r33aKW"
}
```
If you want to track more than one subnet, you can add them as comma separated list. 

As an alternative to the config file you can pass the blockchain ID as parameter during the node start-up with `--track-subnets ie1wUBR2bQDPkGCRf2CBVzmP55eSiyJsFYqeGXnTYt2r33aKW`. 

### Restart Node

After you have updated your config, you have to restart your node to start tracking the Beam subnet. 

**Helpful commands** 

Stop your node: 
```bash copy
sudo systemctl stop avalanchego
```

Check node status: 
```bash copy
sudo systemctl status avalanchego
```

Start your node:
```bash copy
sudo systemctl start avalanchego
```

</Steps>




## Monitoring

If you want to inspect the process of Subnet syncing, you can use the RPC call `platform.getBlockchainStatus`:

```bash /y97omoP2cSyEVfdSztQHXD9EnfnVP9YKjZwAxhUfGbLAPYT9t/ copy
curl -X POST --data '{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": "platform.getBlockchainStatus",
"params":{
"blockchainID":"y97omoP2cSyEVfdSztQHXD9EnfnVP9YKjZwAxhUfGbLAPYT9t"
},
"id": 1
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/P
```

For an explanation of the response, check the [API docs](https://docs.avax.network/apis/avalanchego/apis/p-chain#platformgetblockchainstatus).

If you want to understand your Subnet better, take a look at the blockchain log. Normally, you can find this log in `~/.avalanchego/logs/ChainID.log{:bash}`. Just replace "`ChainID`" with the real ID of your blockchain in your Subnet.

Beam Testnet example logfile location: 
`~/.avalanchego/logs/y97omoP2cSyEVfdSztQHXD9EnfnVP9YKjZwAxhUfGbLAPYT9t.log{:bash}`

To better understand how your Node and Subnet are working, you can set up a tool called Prometheus+Grafana. This tool helps you monitor their performance and comes with easy-to-read charts for regular operations and specific Subnet data. There's a [step-by-step guide](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/setting-up-node-monitoring) available to help you get it all set up.
