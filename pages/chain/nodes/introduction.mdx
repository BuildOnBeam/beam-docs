# How to run a validator node

Beam Nodes are set to go live by the end of Q1 2025, aligning with the Horizon upgrade completion. To run your own Beam Validator Node, you need to install AvalancheGo. The easiest method is using the installer, available [here](https://docs.avax.network/tooling/avalanche-go-installer). Please note that this guide is compatible with AvalancheGo version 1.12.2.

Once you have a running AvalancheGo installation, you need to add the Beam Subnet-EVM to track the Beam L1 in your node.

## Installing the Beam Subnet-EVM

<Steps>
### Downloading the Subnet-EVM

First, download the Subnet-EVM binary from [Ava-Labs GitHub](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) and copy it into the AvalancheGo plugin directory.

```bash /kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz/
mkdir subnetevm
cd subnetevm
wget https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases/download/v0.7.1/subnet-evm_0.7.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf subnet-evm_0.7.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
cp subnet-evm ~/.avalanchego/plugins/kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz
```

<Callout type="info">
  Please ensure you have downloaded the latest [Subnet-EVM
  release](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm/releases).
</Callout>

The long string `kLPs8zGsTVZ28DhP1VefPCFbCgS7o5bDNez8JUxPVw9E6Ubbz` is the CB58 encoded VMID of the Beam Subnet-EVM. AvalancheGo will use the name of this file to determine what VMs are available to run from the plugins directory.

### Tracking the Beam L1

To start tracking the Beam L1, update your node config in your preferred editor.

<Callout type="info">
  The installation script creates the node configuration file at
  `~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json`. If AvalancheGo is built from source, no
  default file is created; you would need to create it manually if needed.
</Callout>

```bash copy
nano ~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json
```

Add the `track-subnets` option to node config.

```json
{
  // .. other configuration
  "track-subnets": "eYwmVU67LmSfZb1RwqCMhBYkFyG8ftxn6jAwqzFmxC9STBWLC"
}
```

As an alternative to the config file you can pass the subnet ID as parameter during the node start-up with `--track-subnets eYwmVU67LmSfZb1RwqCMhBYkFyG8ftxn6jAwqzFmxC9STBWLC`.

### Apply Network Upgrades

Download the latest `upgrade.json` file and place it in the appropriate directory.

Create the config directory for Beam and download the `upgrade.json` file from GitHub:

```bash copy
mkdir ~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn
cd ~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn
```

```bash copy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-subnet/main/subnets/beam-mainnet/upgrade.json
```

If you didn't use the installer, your config directory may be located elsewhere. In that case, place the file in `{chain-config-dir}/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/`, where `2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn` is the `{blockchainID}`.

### Configuring Partial Network Sync

By default, an AvalancheGo node syncs all chains, including the C-Chain and X-Chain. To skip syncing these, update your node config and set `partial-sync-primary-network`.

```bash copy
nano ~/.avalanchego/configs/node.json
```

```json
{
  // .. other configuration
  "partial-sync-primary-network": true
}
```

This setting ensures that only the necessary network components are synchronized, reducing resource usage and improving node startup times.

### Restarting the Node

After updating your configuration, restart your node to begin tracking the Beam L1.

**Commands for Node Management:**

Restart your node:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl restart avalanchego
```

Stop your node:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl stop avalanchego
```

Start your node:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl start avalanchego
```

Check node status:

```bash copy
sudo systemctl status avalanchego
```

To follow the log use (ctrl-c to stop):

```bash copy
sudo journalctl -u avalanchego -f
```

</Steps>

## Monitoring Your Node

If you want to inspect the process of L1 syncing, you can use the RPC call `platform.getBlockchainStatus`:

```bash /2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/ copy
curl -X POST --data '{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": "platform.getBlockchainStatus",
"params":{
"blockchainID":"2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn"
},
"id": 1
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/P
```

Refer to the [API docs](https://docs.avax.network/api-reference/p-chain/api#platformgetblockchainstatus) for a response explanation.

To gain deeper insights into your L1, examine the blockchain log. Normally, you can find this log in `~/.avalanchego/logs/ChainID.log{:bash}`. Just replace `ChainID` with the real ID of your blockchain in your L1.

Beam Mainnet example logfile location:
`~/.avalanchego/logs/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn.log{:bash}`

To better understand how your Node and the L1 are working, you can set up a tool called Prometheus+Grafana. This tool helps you monitor their performance and comes with easy-to-read charts for regular operations and specific L1 data. There's a [step-by-step guide](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/maintain/setting-up-node-monitoring) available to help you get it all set up.

## Next Steps

Now that you've launched your Beam node, what should you do next?

Your Beam node will participate in consensus independently but is not yet a network validator. As a result, the network will not query your node during consensus sampling. If you want to add your node as a validator, follow the instructions on [how to join the network as a validator](/chain/nodes/validator).

Refer to the [AVAX Maintenance](https://docs.avax.network/nodes#maintain) section to understand how to maintain your node.

## Network Upgrades

To keep your node up-to-date with network upgrades, ensure the latest `upgrade.json` in the config directory. It should be placed in `{chain-config-dir}/{blockchainID}/upgrade.json{:bash}`, when using the installer the folder for Beam is:

- Mainnet `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/{:bash}`
- Testnet `~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/y97omoP2cSyEVfdSztQHXD9EnfnVP9YKjZwAxhUfGbLAPYT9t/{:bash}`

<Steps>

### Download latest upgrade.json

```bash copy
cd ~/.avalanchego/configs/chains/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/
curl -o upgrade.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildOnBeam/beam-subnet/main/subnets/beam-mainnet/upgrade.json
```

### Restart your Node

```bash copy
sudo systemctl restart avalanchego
```

</Steps>
