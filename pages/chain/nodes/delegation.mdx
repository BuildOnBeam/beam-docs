# Delegation

As a delegator, you can participate in staking on Beam without operating your own validator. Instead, you delegate trust to an existing validating node.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  During the developer preview mode, delegation is unavailable. [Learn

</Callout>

- To delegate, you only require BEAM.
- The minimum delegation amount is TBD (to be determined) BEAM.
- Select a validator to whom you wish to delegate your stake.
- Rewards are distributed to you by the chosen validator.
