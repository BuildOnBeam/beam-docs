# Delegation

As a delegator, you can participate in staking on Beam without the need to run your own validator. Instead, you delegate trust to an existing validating node.

During the developer preview mode, delegation is not possible. [Learn more](/chain/nodes/validator#developer-preview-mode)
</Callout>

- For delegation, you only need MC.
- The minimum delegation amount is (to be determined) MC.
- Choose a validator to delegate your stake to.
- The rewards are shared with you by the validator.
