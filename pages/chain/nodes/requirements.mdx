# Requirements to Run a Validator

## Hardware Requirements

Avalanche is an incredibly lightweight protocol, so nodes can run on commodity hardware with the following minimum specifications.

- **CPU:** Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
- **RAM:** 16 GiB
- **Storage:** 1 TiB
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12
- **Network:** sustained 5Mbps up/down bandwidth

The node should be configured to accept incoming TCP/IP connections on port `9651`.

<Callout type="info">
  Hardware requirements may scale based on the amount of $BEAM staked on the node
  and network activity. Nodes with significant stakes (500k+ $BEAM) may need
  hardware that exceeds the listed specifications and may also use more
  bandwidth.
</Callout>

## Stake Requirements

In addition to the hardware, running a validator on Beam requires staking a minimum amount of $BEAM tokens. Specifically, you'll need at least 20000 $BEAM.

## Next Steps

If you are sure to meet all the requirements you can now go ahead and [add your node as a validator](/chain/nodes/validator).
