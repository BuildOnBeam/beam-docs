# Validator

## Developer Preview Mode

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
In the developer preview mode, Beam operates under a reputation-based consensus method termed Proof of Authority (PoA). Later this year, we plan to switch the consensus method from Proof of Authority (PoA) to Proof of Stake (PoS). This step is irreversible and hasn't been done on AVAX before, hence our deliberate approach. You can read more about some of the considerations in this [article](https://www.avax.network/blog/elastic-era-considerations-for-subnet-builders).
</Callout>


The switch to Proof of Stake will allow everyone to participate as a [validator or delegator](/chain/nodes/validate-delegate). To be notified first about this switch, follow our Twitter account [@BuildOnBeam](https://twitter.com/BuildOnBeam).

## Running a Beam Validator

To run an Beam validator you'll need to meet [all requirements](/chain/nodes/requirements-validator) and a [running Beam node](/chain/nodes/beam-node). Besides validating the Beam network you are validating the AVAX C-Chain too. 



## Useful Tools

- [Validator Health check](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/validator-health-check/): To view your validator's current health.
- [AVAX Notify](https://notify.avax.network/): Get notified if your validator becomes unresponsive or is out-of-date.
