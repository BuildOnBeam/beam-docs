# Beam Validator

## Developer Preview Mode

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  In the developer preview mode, Beam operates under a reputation-based
  consensus method termed Proof of Authority (PoA). Early next year (Q1), we plan to
  switch the consensus method from Proof of Authority (PoA) to Proof of Stake
  (PoS). This step is irreversible and hasn't been done on AVAX before, hence
  our deliberate approach. You can read more about some of the considerations in
  this
  [article](https://www.avax.network/blog/elastic-era-considerations-for-subnet-builders).
</Callout>

The switch to Proof of Stake will allow everyone to participate as a [validator or delegator](/chain/nodes/validate-delegate). To be notified first about this switch, follow our Twitter account [@BuildOnBeam](https://twitter.com/BuildOnBeam).

## Running a Beam Validator

To operate as a Beam validator, ensure you fulfill [all necessary requirements](/chain/nodes/requirements) and have a [functioning Beam node](/chain/nodes/introduction) in place. Remember, by validating on the Beam Network, you are also validating the AVAX C-Chain.

## Useful Tools

- [Validator Health check](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/validator-health-check/): To view your validator's current health.
- [AVAX Notify](https://notify.avax.network/): Get notified if your validator becomes unresponsive or is out-of-date.
