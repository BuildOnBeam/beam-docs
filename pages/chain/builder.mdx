# Build on Beam 


Beam is a sovereign network focused on gaming, brought to you by the Merit Circle DAO. If you are interested in building on Beam, this is the right place for you. Learn about the prerequisites and requirements needed to get your game or dApp up and running on Beam.


## Why you should build on Beam

### 🔝 Scalability 
Beam can handle up to 4,500 transactions per second, a figure that is substantially higher than many other blockchains. This scalability allows for high-volume transactional activities, making Beam an excellent choice for games expecting heavy traffic or significant user bases.

### 💨 Speed
Beam's transactional finality is approximately one second. This means that once a transaction is made, it is confirmed as final in about one second. This high speed improves user experience, as users don't have to wait for long periods to ensure their transactions are finalized. It is especially beneficial for applications where real-time transactions and interactions are crucial such as gaming.

### 💰 Low transaction fees
Low transaction fees make Beam an attractive choice for developers and users alike. High fees can deter users from interacting with a dApp, limiting its potential user base. Lower fees can enable micro-transactions and high-volume interactions, allowing for more diverse and innovative applications.

### 🌳 Sustainability
Beam will operate its final mainnet on Avalanche using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is far more energy-efficient than the traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism used by platforms like Bitcoin. PoS reduces the network's carbon footprint, aligns with the global trend towards sustainability, and also provides a level of decentralization as anyone with enough tokens can potentially [become a validator](/nodes/requirements-validator).

### 👷‍♂️ EVM Compatibility
Beam is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means developers can write smart contracts in Solidity and deploy them on Beam just like they would on the Ethereum network. This compatibility greatly lowers the barrier to entry for developers already familiar with Ethereum's tools and programming languages, making the transition to Beam much easier.
