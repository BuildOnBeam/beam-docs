# Verifying Contracts

## On subnets.avax.network

To verify a contract using the official `subnets.avax.network` explorer, utilize the [Verifying Contracts Tool](https://subnets.avax.network/tools/verify-contract) available on avax.network.

Follow these steps for verification:

1. Choose **Beam** for the subnet.
2. Input the **contract address** of the desired contract for verification.
3. **Select and upload all your contract files**.
4. Once every file is uploaded, initiate the verification by clicking **Submit Verification**.

For verifying a contract on the Beam testnet, refer to the [Verifying Contracts Tool (Testnet)](https://subnets-test.avax.network/tools/verify-contract?chainId=13337).


## From the command line

The Beam explorer uses [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev) for contract verification. There are plugins and integrations for different smart contract development environments available.
For more information, see the [Sourcify documentation](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/how-to-verify) on contract verification.

### Hardhat

If you're using [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) to deploy your contracts, verification with Sourcify is supported natively. Simply run this command from your project directory to verify all deployed contracts:

```bash
hardhat --network beam sourcify
```

For any other Hardhat project, you could use the plugin [hardhat-sourcify](https://github.com/xtools-at/hardhat-sourcify) and verify them one by one:

```bash
hardhat --network beam verify-sourcify --contract "MyFirstContract" --address 0x12345...
hardhat --network beam verify-sourcify --contract "MySecondContract" --address 0x23456...
```

For all available options, check out the plugin's [documentation](https://github.com/xtools-at/hardhat-sourcify) or run `hardhat help verify-sourcify`.

### Foundry

[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) supports Sourcify out of the box.

- To verify a contract immediately after deploying it, add the `--verify  --verification-provider sourcify` flags to your Foundry deploy command.
- To verify an existing, already deployed contract, run:

```bash
forge verify-contract MyFirstContract \
 0x12345... \
  --chain-id 4337 \
  --verifier sourcify
```

### Truffle

When deploying contracts with Truffle, you can install [truffle-plugin-verify](https://github.com/rkalis/truffle-plugin-verify) and use it like this:
```bash
truffle run verify MyFirstContract MySecondContract --network beam
```
