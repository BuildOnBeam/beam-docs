# Verifying Contracts

## On subnets.avax.network

To verify a contract using the official `subnets.avax.network` explorer, utilize the [Verifying Contracts Tool](https://subnets.avax.network/tools/verify-contract) available on avax.network.

Follow these steps for verification:

1. Choose **Beam** for the subnet.
2. Input the **contract address** of the desired contract for verification.
3. **Select and upload all your contract files**. 
4. Once every file is uploaded, initiate the verification by clicking **Submit Verification**.
