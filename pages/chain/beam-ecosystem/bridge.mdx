# Bridge

Bridging tokens from and to Beam is powered by the [LayerZero protocol](https://layerzero.network/).
To learn more about it and how to use it in your own project, visit our [Omnichain token](/chain/builder/omnichain-tokens) guide.

## FAQ

### What are OFTs?

OFTs refer to Omnichain Fungible Tokens. These tokens are designed to seamlessly traverse various blockchain networks, making them highly versatile. With OFTs, you can send a token across existing chains and even future ones without the need for liquidity or incurring additional fees.

### How do I add my token to the Beam Bridge?

If you're a token owner or developer and want your token to be available for bridging on the Beam network, please reach out by contacting [the Beam team](mailto:hello@onbeam.com).

### Are there any fees associated with the bridge?

LayerZero applies a fee depending on the token and target network, to cover the transaction costs for bridging.
Make sure to always double-check the displayed fee when using [bridge.onbeam.com](https://bridge.onbeam.com).
Users should be also aware of standard network transaction fees which might be applicable depending on the source or destination network.

### Is the Beam Bridge safe?

The LayerZero Bridge is built on top of the robust and secure LayerZero framework. However, as with all cryptocurrency transactions, users are advised to be cautious, double-check all details, and understand the risks involved.

### How to test the Beam Bridge?

Test token contracts have been deployed to Goerli and Fuji for bridging purposes. 

On the _Goerli_ testnet, you can obtain USDC and USDT tokens from our test contracts in the following ways:

**Etherscan**: go to the contract tab, connect your wallet and call the **claim** function to get 100 tokens (every 24h).
  - [USDC on Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x2724A590fe9cC7c66A83204aa11D6ec7Aa8e7C58#writeContract)
  - [USDT on Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x908C7A34a87FD8e207BC4585707E484Ed2c9E8aE#writeContract)

**Uniswap**: swap some GoerliETH to get tokens.
  - [USDC on Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?chain=goerli&inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x2724A590fe9cC7c66A83204aa11D6ec7Aa8e7C58)
  - [USDT on Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?chain=goerli&inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x908C7A34a87FD8e207BC4585707E484Ed2c9E8aE)

On _Fuji_, you can bridge the native AVAX token. Obtain these from the [official faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet). Once you've acquired the tokens, utilize [bridge.onbeam.com](https://bridge.onbeam.com) as you normally would to transfer them to the Beam Testnet.
