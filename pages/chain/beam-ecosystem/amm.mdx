## FAQ

### How does Beam's AMM work?

Beam's AMM operates based on the UniswapV2 protocol, a decentralized protocol for automated liquidity provision on Ethereum. This mechanism allows users to trade tokens without the need for order books, and liquidity providers earn fees for supplying the pool.

### Is there a fee for swapping tokens?

Typically, AMMs charge a fee for each swap, which is distributed to liquidity providers as a reward for supplying liquidity to the pool. Ensure you review the transaction details to understand any fees associated with your swap on Beam's AMM.

### How do I provide liquidity?

1. Navigate to the "Pool" page by visiting [swap.onbeam.com/pool](https://swap.onbeam.com/pool).
2. Select the two tokens you want to supply as liquidity.
3. Input the amount for each token.
4. Click "Supply" and confirm the transaction in your connected wallet.

### What are the risks associated with using AMMs?

AMMs, while efficient, come with certain risks such as impermanent loss, especially for liquidity providers. Ensure you understand these risks and conduct thorough research before engaging in any transactions.
