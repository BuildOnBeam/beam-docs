# Gas Token

The [Merit Circle Token (MC)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/merit-circle) is the native currency used within the Beam network to pay for transactions. This concerns every single transaction that may occur on the network from simply transferring funds to deploying smart contracts.


## How to get MC

The MC token originates on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://etherscan.io/token/0x949D48EcA67b17269629c7194F4b727d4Ef9E5d6).
It can be obtained from various centralized- and [decentralized exchanges](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=mainnet&outputCurrency=0x949D48EcA67b17269629c7194F4b727d4Ef9E5d6),
and can be [bridged](/chain/beam-ecosystem/bridge) from Ethereum to Beam (and back).


## Network Fees

The gas paid for each transaction will then be divided in two categories:

**Validator**: Those who are validating and securing the network, and thereby ensuring its safety and performance will receive a reward in MC tokens in return.

**Burn**: Part of the transaction fee used as gas will be burned and therefore permanently find their way out of circulation causing a deflationary effect.

The precise distribution ratio between these categories remains under consideration.


## Fee Configuration

```json filename="genesis.json"
"feeConfig": {
    "gasLimit": 8000000,
    "targetBlockRate": 2,
    "minBaseFee": 10000000000,
    "targetGas": 50000000,
    "baseFeeChangeDenominator": 72,
    "minBlockGasCost": 0,
    "maxBlockGasCost": 1000000,
    "blockGasCostStep": 100000
}
```
These parameters collectively regulate the gas token economics within Beam, influencing fees and transaction processing on the network. To learn more details about these settings, view https://docs.avax.network/build/subnet/upgrade/customize-a-subnet#fee-config.
