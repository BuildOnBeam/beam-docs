# Beam Nodes

The Horizon upgrade transforms the Beam Network into a fully permissionless Layer 1 blockchain by adopting a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This upgrade empowers users to participate as validators or delegators, providing security to the network while earning rewards.

## Key Information
- The Horizon upgrade introduces a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.
- Validators secure the network by staking at least 1 Node Token and 20,000 BEAM.
- Rewards include transaction fees, protocol fees, and incentive grants.
- Slashing penalties apply for poor performance or malicious behavior.
- Delegators can contribute by staking BEAM and/or Node Tokens without running a node.


## Node Tokens
The Node Token is an ERC-721 token required to operate a Beam Node. These tokens are minted during specified phases and have no supply cap. Learn more on the [Node Token](https://nodes.onbeam.com/) page.

## Delegation
Delegation allows users to stake their BEAM and/or Node Tokens with validators, contributing to network security without running their own node. Learn more on the Delegation page.
