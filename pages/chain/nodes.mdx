# Node

An AvalancheGo node is a key element of the Avalanche blockchain network, maintaining a copy of the distributed ledger and validating transactions. Utilizing the innovative Avalanche consensus protocol, these nodes ensure swift transaction finalization and robust security. They are designed to be user-friendly and versatile, accommodating users with various technical knowledge levels and enabling developers to create unique blockchain applications.

## Building & Maintenance

To learn how to build and maintain your own node, you can find detailed step-by-step instructions [here](https://docs.avax.network/nodes). Additionally, you can find there instructions to run your node with cloud providers like [AWS](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/on-third-party-services/amazon-web-services), [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/on-third-party-services/microsoft-azure), [Google Cloud](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/on-third-party-services/google-cloud), [Alibaba Cloud](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/on-third-party-services/alibaba), or [Tencent Cloud](https://docs.avax.network/nodes/on-third-party-services/tencent).
