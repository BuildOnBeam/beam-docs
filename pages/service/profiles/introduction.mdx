# Introduction to Profiles

As you are implementing Beam into your product, the first interaction you will most likely have with our SDK are with Profiles. Profiles can have different purposes and meaning depending on your games.

Profiles are on-chain [account abstractions](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction) that possibly will, or possibly will not contain assets - controlled by the `Secret` API key we provided you. Please note that - while technically possible - Profiles **are not meant to contain any user assets**. If you're looking for a solution to manage user asserts, please look into our [self-custody](/service/introduction-player-api) solution.

In order to full understand Profiles it is important to understand all of the possibilities that you have, here are some articles to get you started:

- [Creating profiles](/service/profiles/creating-profiles): Creating profiles based on an identifier
- [Match profiles](/service/profiles/match-profiles): Match profiles (escrow-style games)
- [Minting profiles](/service/profiles/minting-profiles): For minting assets on demand
- [Treasury profiles](/service/profiles/treasury-profiles): For distributing pre-minted assets
