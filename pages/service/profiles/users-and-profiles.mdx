# Users and profiles

What is important to understand is that the Profiles entity within Beam is not exclusively a matter of players. Profiles could be used for various purposes, one of which is [match profiles](/service/profiles/match-profiles).

However - in our opinion - it makes a ton of sense to create a Profile for each of your players as soon as you want something to happen on-chain. You can use these player profiles to manage a user their assets. On-chain they earned (or bought), NFTs they minted (or you minted on their behalf) all can be send to the player profile for each player.

In order to allow players to see and manage their assets outside of your game, we offer a way to link-up their profile to an SSO authenticated user identity. While it's not required, the companion app offers an extension of the web3 experience where users are able to manage, give a way and trade assets, without you having to facilitate this.


### Connection request

If you want to allow players to control their assets outside of your game, providing them the web3 experience, you would need ot create a connection request for a profile.

```typescript
const request = await beam.profiles.createConnectionRequest('player-profile-id', {
    callbackUrl: 'https://your-games-backend.your-game.com/api/incoming-webhook/player-profile-id'
});

// {
//   "id": "string",
//   "challenge": "c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470",
//   "validUntil": "2023-08-30T08:35:08+00:00"
// }
```

The `challenge` property that we send you when you created this Connection request is essentially a key meant solely for the player behind the profile you want to link up to a user within Beam.

The next step is allowing the user to obtain the challenge we created within the app, as this challenge enables up to create the connection.

* If your game is running on a console, PC or within a browser - we recommend you to encode the challenge in a QR code
* If your game is running on iOS or Android, you could pass the challenge down a deeplink that opens up the Beam companion app

The user will scan the QR code with the companion app, which is how we create a relationship between the user in Beam and the player profile you've registered. By providing a `callbackUrl` when creating a Connection request, we'll be able to provide you with an incoming webhook telling you that a profile was linked up to a user.

### Verifying the incoming webhook

The incoming webhook doesn't tell you to which user a profile is linked to, but it does confirm to you that a link was made between the app-user and your game's profile. When the incoming webhook arrives, there will be a `Signature` header included in it. The signature can be ignored completely, but allows you to verify whenever the incoming request we send you indeed is coming from Beam. The implementation for handling this signature are platform specific and you are required to use [Libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/). Below you will find an example on how to verify the signature within a Node.js based backend.

```typescript
import * as sodium from 'sodium-native';

export const verifySignature = (
  incomingRequestBody: Record<string, string>, // The request body of the incoming webhook
  incomingRequestHeaderSignature: string, // The 'signature' header of the incoming webhook
  yourApiKey: string, // The api key you've used to create the connection request
): boolean => {
  const payloadString = JSON.stringify(incomingRequestBody);
  const payloadBuffer = Buffer.from(payloadString, 'utf8');
  const signature = Buffer.from(incomingRequestHeaderSignature, 'hex');
  const secretBuffer = Buffer.from(yourApiKey, 'utf8');

  return sodium.crypto_auth_verify(signature, payloadBuffer, secretBuffer); // will return `true` or `false`
};
```
