# How to sign with a session

Once the session is successfully created, it's authorized to sign [Operations](/service/operations/introduction). As the game developer, you're simply able to apply the same method as was described in [Processing Operations](/service/operations/processing-operations).

If a session is active for the user, the session key is still available in the local storage of the game client and the session is authorized to sign - `SignOperationAsync()` will automatically sign the Operation, without having the user seeing a browser.


```csharp
            var operationId = "clxn9u(...)0c4bz7av";
            var operationResult = await m_BeamClient.SignOperationAsync(
                entityId: "your-entity-id",
                operationId: operationId,
                signingBy: OperationSigningBy.Auto  // accepts Auto, Browser and Session
                );

            if (operationResult.Status == BeamResultType.Success)
            {
                var operationStatus = operationResult.Result;
                var isApproved = operationResult.Result == CommonOperationResponse.StatusEnum.Executed;
                var isRejected = operationResult.Result == CommonOperationResponse.StatusEnum.Rejected;
                // (...)
            }
```
