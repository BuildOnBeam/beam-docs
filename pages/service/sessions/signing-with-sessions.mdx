# How to sign with a session

Once the session is successfully created, it's authorized to sign [Operations](/service/operations/introduction). As the game developer, you're simply able to apply the same method as was described in [Processing Operations](/service/operations/processing-operations).

If a session is active for the user, the session key is still available in the local storage of the game client and the session is authorized to sign - `beamClient.SignOperation` will automatically sign the Operation, without the user ever touching a browser.


```csharp
StartCoroutine(beamClient.SignOperation("entity-id-of-user", "operation-id-of-api", result =>
    {
        // handle the result here
    },
    chainId: 13337, // defaults to 13337
    secondsTimeout: 240, // timeout in seconds for getting a response in case browser flow was chosen
    fallBackToBrowser: true // if true, opens a browser for the user to sign the operation if Session was not started
));
```
