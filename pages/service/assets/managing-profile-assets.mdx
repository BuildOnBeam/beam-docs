# Managing profile assets

Through the API key, you are authorized to manage assets for all the profiles you created, for every contract we registered to your game. The methods described below are avaialble, but obviously ERC20 token transfers will only be relevant to you if we added an ERC20 contract to your game within Beam.

## Users and asset transfers

Note that depending on the role of our companion app within your game, [users that linked up to a profile](/service/profiles/users-and-profiles) you created are also able to manage the assets within a profile to their own liking. They can send assets to friends, send them to a self-custodial wallet on Beam or bridge them over to another chain.

### Currency transfers (ERC20)

If we registered an ERC20 contract for your game, you are able to manage the ERC20 assets in all the profiles that you created. Sending around these tokens is easy. We simply expect you to know the ID of the sender, as well as the ID of the receiver, both of which you should have created a Profile for.

Initiating a token transfer would look something like this. In the example below, we are not considering more complicated features like sponsoring transactions just yet - the transaction will be paid for by you - the game developer.

```typescript
const transaction = await beam.assets.transferToken("your-sender-id", {
  receiverEntityId: "your-receiver-id",
  assetAddress: "your-contract-address",
  amountToTransfer: "10", // 10 means 10 - we don't expect you to consider any other format like gwei
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }
```

### NFTs transfers (ERC721, ERC1155)

Asset transfers work in a similar fashion as ERC20 token transfers, but instead of calling the `transferToken`, you will need to call the `transferAsset` method and pass an `assetId` property for the asset you want to move around.

```typescript
const transaction = await beam.assets.transferAsset("your-sender-id", {
  receiverEntityId: "your-receiver-id",
  assetAddress: "your-contract-address",
  assetId: 73,
  amountToTransfer: "1", // amountToTransfer is related to 1155, defaults to 1 and doesn't have to be passed for ERC721 contracts.
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }
```

### Native transfers (Merit Circle)

Lastly - we offer you the possibility to transfer our native token: Merit Circle. Depending on the context of your game, you might want to be able to transfer our native token around between profiles.

```typescript
const transaction = await beam.assets.transferAsset("your-sender-id", {
  receiverEntityId: "your-receiver-id",
  amountToTransfer: "10", // 10 means 10 - we don't expect you to consider any other format like gwei
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }
```
