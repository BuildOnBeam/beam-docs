# Marketplace

In order to get a marketplace going, we offer various methods that can help you get started with listing assets. Keep in mind that our marketplace serves a crucial role within the asset related methods, but that the marketplace itself is a pre-release product waiting to be released in Q4.

At the moment of writing, the sole token that serves that flows through the marketplace on Beam contracts is MC. This means that you are able to create marketplace listings based on an asking price in MC, and that profiles that want to buy assets need to be funded with MC as well. [In the future, we will offer programmatic swaps](/service/roadmap) that allows you to swap between an existing in-game token within a profile to MC based on the avaialblity of a liquidity pool on https://swap.onbeam.com/


## Listing an asset

The first thing you probably want to do is to list an existing asset in a profile. In order to list an asset you need to pass us some information about the listing.

```typescript
const listingTransaction = await beam.assets.listAsset('seller-profile-id', {
    assetId: 73,
    quantity: 1 // You can list multiple 1155 assets from the same token, defaults to 1
    price: '1000', // Listing price in Merit Circle token
    sellType: 'FixedPrice' // AscendingAuction, DescendingAuction or FixedPrice

    startTime: '', // auction start time, only needed with the AscendingAuction and DescendingAuction sell types
    endTime: '', // auction end time, only needed with the AscendingAuction and DescendingAuction sell types
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }
```

Different intricacies on the different selling types will be provided at a later date. To keep things simple, we advice to start listing with the 'FixedPrice' sell type only.


## Accessing listed items for your game

At the moment, we provide a method that allows you to retrieve all the listed items of a profile. Since we just listed an item, you can now verify whenever the item is actually for sale by calling the `getListedAssetsForProfile` method.


```typescript
const profileListings = await beam.assets.getListedAssetsForProfile('seller-profile-id', {
    offset: 0,  // optional, defaults to 0
    limit: 10 // optional, defaults to 10
});

// {
//   "data": [
//     {
//       "id": "string",
//       "price": "string",
//       "sellType": "string",
//       "startPrice": "string",
//       "endPrice": "string",
//       "platformFee": 0,
//       "royaltyFee": 0,
//       "currency": "string",
//       "startTime": "string",
//       "endTime": "string",
//       "quantityListed": 0,
//       "signedOrderId": "string",
//       "expiresAt": "string",
//       "sellerAddress": "string",
//       "contractId": "string",
//       "nft": {
//         "id": "string",
//         "name": "string",
//         "imageUrl": "string",
//         "assetType": "string",
//         "assetAddress": "string",
//         "assetId": "string"
//       }
//     }
//   ],
//   "pagination": {
//     "count": 0,
//     "limit": 10,
//     "offset": 0
//   }
// }

```



## Buying a listed item

If a user shows interest in a listing for sale by another profile, it's possible to buy the listed asset with a profile by simply calling the `buyListedAsset` method. Note that in order to actually buy the asset, the buyer-profile needs to be funded with enough MC based on the listing price set by the seller profile.

```typescript
const profileListings = await beam.assets.buyListedAsset('buyer-profile-id', {
    orderId: '' // data[0].signedOrderId from the getListedAssetsForProfile method,
    quantity: 1 // the amount of NFTs to buy, only relevant for ERC-1155 based tokens, defaults to 1
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }

```


### Roadmap

Throughout the coming months, we'll be releasing additional features that will help you to provide a more complete marketplace experience, with features ranging from programmatic offers, auctions and extensive filtering options to allow you to create a full-fledged in-game marketplace solely by relying on the Beam marketplace.
