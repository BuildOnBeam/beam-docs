# Environments

When implementing on Beam, you probably want to get started on the Beam testnet before deploying to the mainnet. You can do this by using your testnet api key and using the following base URL in either the SDK or by calling the endpoints directly.

````md filename="BASE URL"
https://api.testnet.onbeam.com
````

Once you are ready to deploy your game to mainnet, simply request the production api key from your contact at Beam, and switch out the hostname to the following domain:

````md filename="BASE URL"
https://api.mainnet.onbeam.com
````

## api keys and environments

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Keep in mind that keys are not interchangeable per environment, meaning that you will need to send the correct key in the `x-api-key` header based on the hostname you use.
