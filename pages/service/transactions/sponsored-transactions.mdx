# Sponsoring transactions

By default, all transactions are **sponsored by you**. Sponsoring transactions means that the in-game accounts don't need to have any MC in their ownership in order for you to move funds from A-to-B.

### Why are transactions sponsored by default?

We think this default is sensible, as it's you as the game developer are in control of when a transaction happens. We consider it your responsbility as a game developer to create a viable economic model where sponsored and self-paid transactions (through MC or custom charges) go hand in hand to create the best experience for the gamer.

To paint a clearer picture on how this looks like, below you'll find a transaction which is sponosred

```typescript
const transaction = await beam.assets.transferAsset("your-sender-id", {
  receiverEntityId: "your-receiver-id",
  assetAddress: "your-contract-address",
  assetId: "73",
  // ...
  sponsor: true, // ðŸ‘ˆ true is also the default.
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',

// }
```
