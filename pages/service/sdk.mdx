# SDK

The recommended way to interact with the Beam API is by using one of our official SDKs. All of the provided SDKs are meant to be used **server side**, as it's crucial to not expose any of the API keys we provided publicly.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  It's of the utmost importants that your API key never gets exposed. If your API key is / has been at risk of being exposed, please contact build@onbeam.com.
</Callout>
