# Beam SDKs

The recommended way to interact with the Beam API is by using one of our official SDKs.

At the time of writing, the SDKs we're shipping are all automatically generated after every service release. We're currently using [OpenAPI generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) and [OpenAPI Typescript Codegen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi-typescript-codegen).

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  It's of the utmost importance that your API key never gets exposed. If your
  API key is / has been at risk of being exposed, please contact
  build@onbeam.com. Alternatively: re-create your API keys yourself using the
  provided regenerate-key, the old ones will automatically be invalidated.
</Callout>

### SDKs

In order to get started, we currently provide the following SDKs. Note that if there's no available SDK available for your preferred language, there's always the possibility of directly connecting to the RESTful endpoints by passing your API key in the `x-api-key` header.


#### Custodial SDKs

All of the custodial SDKs are meant to be used **server side**, as it's crucial to not expose any of the api keys we provided publicly.

#### Self-custody SDKs

The self-custody SDKs can be used in the client, as the API that is required to interact with the self-custody services can be exposed without risk.

### Beam SDK repository

If you're interested in how we generate the SDK, have a look at the [Github repository](https://github.com/Merit-Circle/beam-sdk). If you don't want to use our provided SDKs, it might still be of inspiration.

### Releases

If you are interested in more granular changelogs for SDK releases, have a look at our [Github releases](https://github.com/Merit-Circle/beam-sdk/releases)

Every deployment of the Beam API leads to a new **patch** version of the SDK being released. With every release, the release description in the Github release contains a description that explains the difference between the previous and new version based on the REStful endpoints.

In the future, we hope to automatically assess major, minor and patch versions, but we currently rely on patch incrementals only.

### Beam OpenAPI specification

Beam OpenAPI specification empowers you with a broad set of developer tooling, starting with Postman collections and generating your own SDK. It also serves as the basis for our generated release changelogs and SDKs.
