# Beam Companion

We recently released the Beam Companion app. The app allows users to manage and access their on-chain NFTs earned through playing your game.

Through our SDK implementation, we give you the power to generate a secure connection request that enables the user to create a connection between their in-game profile and Beam identity account (the in-app user).

  Make sure you connect to Beam testnet in order to implement the application
  during your development process. You can switch to testnet by switching on the
  log-in screen of the app.

### Integrate the app

Unlock the full potential for your user by implementing the Beam Companion app in a couple of simple steps.

- [Connecting your users](/service/companion/connecting-your-users): Create the connection through a QR code or deeplink

- [Verifying connections](/service/companion/verifying-webhooks): Verify whenever a connection has been created
