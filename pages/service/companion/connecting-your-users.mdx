## Connecting your users to the Beam Companion

What is important to understand is that the Profiles entity within Beam is not exclusively a matter of players. Profiles could be used for various purposes, one of which is [match profiles](/service/profiles/match-profiles).

However - in our opinion - it makes a ton of sense to create a Profile for each of your players as soon as you want something to happen on-chain. You can use these player profiles to manage a user their assets. On-chain they earned (or bought), NFTs they minted (or you minted on their behalf) all can be send to the player profile for each player.

In order to allow players to see and manage their assets outside of your game, we offer a way to link-up their profile to an SSO authenticated user identity. While it's not required, the companion app offers an extension of the web3 experience where users are able to manage, give a way and trade assets, without you having to facilitate this.

### Connection request

If you want to allow players to control their assets outside of your game, providing them the web3 experience, you would need ot create a connection request for a profile.

```typescript
const request = await beam.profiles.createConnectionRequest('profile-id', {
	callbackUrl: 'https://your-games-backend.your-game.com/api/incoming-webhook/:profile-id',
})

// {
//   "id": "string",
//   "challenge": "c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470",
//   "validUntil": "2023-08-30T08:35:08+00:00"
// }
```

The `challenge` property that we send you when you created this Connection request is essentially a key meant solely for the player behind the profile you want to link up to a user within Beam.

The next step is allowing the user to obtain the challenge we created within the app, as this challenge enables up to create the connection.

#### QR code

If your game is running on a console, PC, or in a browser, we suggest encoding the challenge in a QR code. The user can scan the QR code, which establishes a link between the user in Beam and the player profile you have registered. We suggest creating a QR code that includes the following information:

```md filename="QR CODE"
https://account.onbeam.com/connection-request?challenge=c5d2...
```

This implementation guides users who do not have the app installed to the website where they can find links to download the app on their device. If users already have the app installed and scan the QR code using their native camera app, they will be directed to the companion app. Additionally, if users scan it from within the companion app, the connection request will also be handled correctly.

#### Deeplink

If your game is running on iOS or Android, you could pass the challenge down a deeplink that opens up the Beam companion app. This can be achieved in two ways:

```md filename="URL SCHEME DEEPLINK"
beam-companion-app://connection-request?challenge=c5d2...
```

```md filename="BEAM SITE DEEPLINK (RECOMMENDED)"
https://account.onbeam.com/connection-request?challenge=c5d2...
```

We suggest going with the second option. It'll produce the same result as the QR code setup we mentioned earlier. In this case, users who don't have the companion app already installed will be directed to a website where they can easily find links to download the app on their device.

#### Webhook

By providing a `callbackUrl` when creating a Connection request, we'll be able to provide you with an incoming webhook telling you that a profile was linked up to a user.
