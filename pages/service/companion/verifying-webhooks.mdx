# Verify user connections

After the user scans the QR code and connects their user-account to the profile, you will receive an incoming webhook on the provided callbackUrl.

```typescript
const request = await beam.profiles.createConnectionRequest("profile-id", {
  callbackUrl:
    "https://your-games-backend.your-game.com/api/incoming-webhook/:profile-id",
});
```

The incoming webhook doesn't tell you to which user a profile is linked to, but it does confirm to you that a link was made between the app-user and your game's profile.

### Verify the incoming request

When the incoming webhook arrives, there will be a `Signature` header included in it. The signature can be ignored completely, but allows you to verify whenever the incoming request we send you indeed is coming from Beam. The implementation for handling this signature are platform specific and you are required to use [Libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/). Below you will find an example on how to verify the signature within a Node.js based backend.

```typescript
import * as sodium from "sodium-native";

export const verifySignature = (
  incomingRequestBody: Record<string, string>, // The request body of the incoming webhook
  incomingRequestHeaderSignature: string, // The 'signature' header of the incoming webhook
  yourApiKey: string // The api key you've used to create the connection request
): boolean => {
  const payloadString = JSON.stringify(incomingRequestBody);
  const payloadBuffer = Buffer.from(payloadString, "utf8");
  const signature = Buffer.from(incomingRequestHeaderSignature, "hex");
  const secretBuffer = Buffer.from(yourApiKey, "utf8");

  return sodium.crypto_auth_verify(signature, payloadBuffer, secretBuffer); // will return `true` or `false`
};
```
