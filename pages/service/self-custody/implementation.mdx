# Getting started with the implementation

The implementation of our new self-custodial service consists of two components

- The client side component. We currently solely provide a **C# sdk** meant to be implemented in the **Unity**. In the future, we will be releasing more implementations for various platforms.
- The server client. We currently provide a **C# and Typescript** server client.


In the near future, we expect to expand the client side component with all the server client methods, so that you also have the option to implement completely in the client.


### Initialize the client side sdk

In order to initialize the Unity (C# client sdk), you will need a new type of API key - the `Publishable` API key. You will be able to find this API key by regenerating your API keys through the existing API. You can do so programmatically, or by interacting with the method in the [OpenAPI / Swagger UI](https://api.testnet.onbeam.com/api/game#/Game/regenerateApiKeys) interface.


```csharp

var beamClient = gameObject.AddComponent<BeamClient>()
  .SetBeamApiGame("your-game-id", "your-publishable-api-key")
  .SetEnvironment(BeamEnvironment.Testnet);
```


### Server client

The server client is a new client which can be used to generate [Operations](/service/operations/introduction). Both server clients we offer for the new self-custodial services, are structured in similar fashion to the existing SDKs that offer custodial [Profiles](/service/profiles/introduction).

Keep in mind that we expect you to use the `Publishable` API key currently, on both the client-side and the server client when interacting with the self-custody service.
