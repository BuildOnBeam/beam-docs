# Assets

Asset management is a crucial part of the Beam integration within your game. Depending on on-chain activities that you want to support in your in-game economy, you have the option to manage assets on behalf of the profiles you created, but also list - buy and make offers on assets through the Beam sdk.

By providing these options through the sdk, you are able to create a frictionless in-game marketplace built on beam without having to worry about creating infrastructure to support it.

### Roadmap

Throughout the coming months, we'll be releasing additional features that will help you to provide a more complete marketplace experience, with features ranging from programmatic offers, auctions and extensive filtering options to allow you to create a full-fledged in-game marketplace solely by relying on the Beam marketplace.
