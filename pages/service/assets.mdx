# Assets

An important aspect of Profiles are Assets. Profiles are custodial, and authorized through your api key you are able to transfer / trade and manage assets of the profiles of your users - for as long as the users are custodial. In late 2023, we're aiming to release a feature for users to take self-custody of their accounts, but you'll be in control of implementing the feature to allow them to take custody. This means that once you are integrating the [User connection](/service/users) functionality of Beam, you should consider that the user could become a self-custodial user at any moment.


### Managing assets between profiles
Profiles are custodial, and through your api key you are able to transfer / trade and manage assets of the profiles of your users - for as long as the users are custodial.

```typescript
import { Beam } from '@onbeam/node';
 
const beam = new Beam('x-api-key');
 
const transfer = await beam.assets.transfer({
  sender: 'ProfileID-A',
  receiver: 'ProfileID-B',
  assetAddress: '0x0',
  tokenId: 23
})
```

## Who owns the assets in the profiles?

Profiles are **custodial**. This means that the creator of the profile - you - will be able to manage the profile, and transfer assets in and out of the profile authorized by your api key.

We allow the [user](/service/users) that links up to the profile, to also manage these assets through the upcoming Beam companion app. This means that assets that you provide to the profile, could be there at one moment, but could be sold to another player of your game in the next moment.
