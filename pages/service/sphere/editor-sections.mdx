# Editor sections
When creating your collection page within the collection editor you'll have plenty of sections to choose from to create your own unique branded page, we'll dive a bit into all the different sections on this page.
You can view the minimum requirements to create a collection page [here](/service/sphere/publish-collections#minimum-requirements).

Sections suffixed with an asterix are required to create a collection page. {/* TODO: check copy / wording */}

## Header*
The header section consists of a background image, your logo, stats from your collection and your social links.
You're able to adjust both images and your social links.
<Callout>
  We recommend using an image with dimensions of at least 3840 x 2160 pixels for your background image, and a minimum height of 200 pixels for your logo.

## Introduction text*
{/* TODO: check copy / wording */}
The text in this section gets automatically animated into smaller chunks by splitting up your text on all comma's and periods.
The text can have a maximum length of 300 characters. You'll also be able to create your own gradient or pick one of the pre defined ones, we also use this gradient for the scrollbar on your collection page.
{/* TODO: add preview image */}

## NFT gallery
Within this section you can simply enter token id's, we'll automatically fetch the images of all tokens to display them in an animated gallery. You can select up to 20 different token id's.
<Callout>
  We recommend adding your tokens in pairs of 4, since this will result in a consistent grid.
