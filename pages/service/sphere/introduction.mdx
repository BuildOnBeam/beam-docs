# Introduction to Sphere

Sphere is the marketplace for games, the backbone of game developers to launch an in-game marketplace. It is the very first marketplace to have ever successfully integrated the Immutable zkEVM testnet and mainnet. Sphere can be used on Beam and Immutable zkEVM. Learn more about the Immutable zkEVM integration and its benefits [here](https://medium.com/@meritcircle/sphere-launches-as-first-marketplace-to-integrate-with-immutable-zkevm-757a565d7f99).

### The only gaming marketplace you will ever need

As a marketplace, Sphere covers all the bases. First, it acts as an aggregator, presenting a huge range of assets from multiple games that users can search within and browse through — kind of a digital catalog. But Sphere also facilitates in-game marketplaces. Thanks to the [Beam SDK](/service/sdk), anyone who’s building a game has the ability to spin up a marketplace within the game, where players can buy, sell and trade their assets. It all happens under the hood, so it doesn’t disrupt the gamer’s experience, and Sphere collects fees on each transaction.

### Sphere Features
- **Aggregator**: Sphere acts as an aggregator, presenting a huge range of assets from multiple games that users can search within and browse through.

- **Beam SDK**: Thanks to the Beam SDK, anyone who’s building a game has the ability to spin up a marketplace within the game, where players can buy, sell and trade their assets. It all happens under the hood, so it doesn’t disrupt the gamer’s experience, and Sphere collects fees on each transaction.

- **Login with Immutable Passport**: This passport is the gateway for many gamers into the realms of web3, and allows them to take ownership of their gaming assets into their own hands - possibly for the first time ever. Learn more about the Immutable Passport [here](https://www.immutable.com/products/passport).

- **Immutable Orderbook**: Sphere integrates the Immutable Orderbook, which allows for more universal handling of gaming assets across marketplaces. In practice this means that the orders and assets on marketplaces that are available on the Immutable zkEVM will simultaneously be available on the Sphere marketplace and vice versa.
