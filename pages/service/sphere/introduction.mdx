# Introduction to Sphere

In its current form, Sphere is a marketplace for any type of asset. It's built by gamers, and with gamers in mind, but has a long way to go before becoming a true gaming marketplace. We're aware of this, and are determined to make Sphere more gaming-oriented. One example is by illustrating the assets' potential in-game more explicitly. Additionally, a design-focused overhaul is scheduled to accompany the major adjustment that's coming up for Sphere.

Currently, Sphere only supports the Beam network. However, given our collaboration with [Immutable and Polygon](https://medium.com/@meritcircle/beam-joins-forces-with-immutable-and-polygon-labs-for-multichain-expansion-and-product-development-87fbeb9f6efe), we are broadening that scope. In the near future, Sphere will support the Immutable zkEVM and index every single collection on that network. Immutable zkEVM is built specifically for gaming, and we can't wait to become the native marketplace for this chain.

Working closely with Immutable, we are also integrating their Orderbook, and other functionalities such as the Passport feature. This is an important step for Sphere, but again, only one aspect of its potential. Once Sphere is embedded in the Beam SDK, any game developer will be able to spin up their in-game marketplace powered by Sphere. This is a feature we are destined to see live in the upcoming year in a variety of games.
