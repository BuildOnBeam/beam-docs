# Publishing your collection

Make your collection stand out on Sphere by adding your personal touch and creating a branded collection page. Before you get started, just follow a few simple steps:

## Mint a token
You'll need to mint at least one token for your collection to be displayed on Sphere. Once you've done that, our system will pick up your collection automatically. After minting at least one token you can check out your collection page at:
```md filename="MAINNET"
sphere.market/beam/collections/{contract-address}
```
```md filename="TESTNET"
testnet.sphere.market/beam-testnet/collections/{contract-address}
```

## Become a creator
To edit your collection, you need to become a recognized creator on Sphere. Get flagged as a creator by one of our admins (decide which wallet address you would want to use for this and request this through the Partner Success Manager or Business Development Lead you're in contact with), and you'll have the power to edit the collections you've created.

  This step needs to be taken for every new collection. Even if you're already a creator on Sphere.

## Edit your collection
Once you've completed the first two steps, find your collections on the Collections tab of your Sphere account (that matches the wallet address you've sent to our admins). Click on the **Customize Collection** button, and easily make changes using the collection editor.
