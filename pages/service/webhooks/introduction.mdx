# Introduction to Webhooks

If you want to be aware of all asset transfers, even outside our API, you can utilize Webhooks.

### Testing locally
We highly recommend to test your Webhook locally first. To do that, you can use a tool like https://ngrok.com to quickly expose your application to the outside world.
After running ngrok simply take the url it generates for you, it should have a following format: `https://2be4-(...)-75.ngrok-free.app` and use it as your Webhook's `url`.

### Registering Webhooks
To learn how to listen to specific events, visit one of the pages:
- [Token Transfers](/service/webhooks/token-transfers): Listen to token transfers

<Callout emoji="🛠️">
    For now we only support Token transfer related events. We plan on exposing more events in the near future like marketplace Listings, Offers etc.

### Delivery
Each request will be a `POST` with an array of events like this:
```json
[
   {
      "type":"TokenTransfers",
      "contractFunction":"TransferSingle",
      "contractAddress":"0xd71(...)272e",
      "from":{
         "address":"0x607(...)468",
         "externalEntityId":"SomeEntityId" // 👈 only added if this address is owned by one of your players
      },
      "to":{
         "address":"0x9b5(...)7D2",
         "externalEntityId":"SomeOtherEntityId" // 👈 only added if this address is owned by one of your players
      },
      "transfers":[
         {
            "tokenId":"123",
            "amount":"2"
         }
      ],
      "blockNumber":"967046",
      "transactionHash":"0xa707(...)b04"
   },
  (...)
]
```
Our implementation expects any 2xx code in response and will retry if that's not the case.
We will try to deliver each request `three times` in 10, 20 then 30 second intervals.

### Verifying signatures
When you create a Webhook, in the response you will receive a parameter called `signature`. It's important to store it somewhere, so you can later find out whether data came from Beam, as each event sent will contain a `X-Webhook-Signature` header, that will contain the `signature`.
All sent events will also contain a `transactionHash` so you can find and verify them on the chain if needed.

### Others
You can list all your registered Webhooks and remove any of them via the API or SDK:
```typescript
// list
const webhooks = await beam.webhooks.getWebhooksForGame();

// delete
await beam.webhooks.deleteWebhook(webhookId);
```
