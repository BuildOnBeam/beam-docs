title: Self-custody
---

# Introduction to the Player API (beta)

Through our Player API implementation, you can set up self-custodial user accounts with Beam. The solution is based on self-custodial private keys and newly deployed account abstractions. Existing Automation [Profiles](/service/profiles/introduction), won't be available for use in self-custodial Player solution.

### What is self custody?

Self-custody means that a private key is only controllable by the user, who can sign transactions. The private key for each user is generated in the browser when they start interacting with [Sessions](/service/sessions/introduction) and [Operations](/service/operations/introduction).
When they do, they will be required to authorize with a social identity, from which a private key is generated and sharded - and securely stored.

### Disclaimer

Our self-custodial implementation is **subject to change**, while the basis of the implementation will remain more or less the same, we have different improvements in mind that will make the experience even better - for both you (the game developer) and the end user.
