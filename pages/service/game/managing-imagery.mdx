## Managing imagery

In the Beam Companion app, we'll want to show you a few visuals related to your game. In order to do this we currently allow you to store three different images, each with their own purpose.

- **coverImageUrl**: (16:9 ratio, eg; 1280x720), we're using this image in the game overview interface of the companion app
- **backgroundImageUrl** (1:1 ratio, eg; 960x960), we're using this image in the game detail page as a background image for the header, we advice you to not put text in this image
- **logoImageUrl** (1:1 ratio, eg; 320x320), we're using this image in the game detail page on top of the background image, and as a reference to the game in the asset overview
