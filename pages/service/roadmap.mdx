# Upcoming features

Throughout the rest of 2023, we'll be working had to provide with additional features within the Beam sdk or related products (like the Beam marketplace).

As we are working with multiple game development studios in order to ensure the success of Beam and the integration of it within the developers their games, we will shift more granular priorities throughout time as we see fit to ensure partners success. Therefore, the roadmap serves as a set of handlebars - not an exact promise.

## Q3 2023

* Asset management through the Beam sdk (managing assets, buying & selling through Beam marketplace)
    1. Transferring assets (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and native tokens) between profiles
    2. Listing assets through the Beam marketplace
    3. Buying assets through the Beam marketplace
    4. Viewing assets, and listed assets, for specific profiles 
* Transaction policies (paying for profile transactions, or charging users an on-chain currency)
    1. The possibility of creating transaction policies to charge users ERC20 tokens to fulfill a transaction
    2. The possibility of sponsoring transactions for your users
* Swapping assets through the Beam sdk
    1. Programmatic swaps based on deployed liquidity pools on https://swap.onbeam.com

## Q4 2023

* Release of the Beam companion app
    1. The initial release will be in October. The application will support a way to link-up to [player profiles](/profiles/users-and-profiles), and view their in-game assets within those profiles
    2. Throughout Q4, we will be deploying additional features like transferring assets, buying / listing on Beam marketplace through the app and asset swaps
    3. Late 2023, we expect to release a feature called Beam Vaults, which will be a semi-self-custodial or self-custodial way for users to interact with their assets
* Release of Beam marketplace
    1. Allowing game devs to create editorial pages for their in-game assets on the marketplace
    2. Allowing game devs to interact with listings on the beam marketplace through the Beam sdk
* On-chain event subscriptions through Queues
    1. Allowing game devs to listen to on-chain actions taken by users outside of the game developers control
    2. Allowing game devs to be aware of transactions being completed without having to implement polling
* A Beam provided identity solution
    1. Allowing game devs to implement 'Log-in with Beam' without them having to implement their own authentication solution
    2. Log-in works through scanning a QR code generated through the Beam sdk, scanned by the user within the Beam companion app
