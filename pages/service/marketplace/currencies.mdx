At the moment of writing the Beam marketplace supports a couple of pre-configured tokens for all markteplace interactions. For the Beam chain, these tokens are

- Merit Circle token (the native token)
- USDC
- USDT

## Supporting in-game currencies

Depending on your needs, we're able to add additional ERC20 tokens that are also registered for your game on Beam, allowing you to interact with the Marketplace based on your own in-game currency. However, do keep in mind that if you list assets in your own currency on Sphere, you probably also want to consdier adding a liqduity pool on the Beam swap in order to facilitate users who might not be playing your game yet, but are still interested in obtaining one of it's assets through the marketplace.

## Requesting your token to be added

Currently, adding a currency to Beam marketplace requires us to take a couple of manual steps. If you're intereed in adding your token, contact the team through Slack or build@onbeam.com
