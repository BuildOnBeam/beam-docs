# Making an offer

Assets in the Beam marketplace are listed in specific currencies, for specific listing prices. That price might just not be right based on the current market value. In order to do this we allow you to create offers on both listed and unlisted assets in the marketplace.

### Currencies

As mentioned in the [currencies](/service/marketplace/currencies) page for the Marketplace, depending on the chain you're implementing on, you're limited to the available currencies for the chain available in Sphere. Offers are scoped to the same flexibility as the listing and buying process itself: The supported currencies for the chain you use, are the same currencies you can use for creating an offer.
