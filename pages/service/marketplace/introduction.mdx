# Marketplace

In order to get a marketplace going, we offer various methods that can help you get started with listing assets.
Keep in mind that our marketplace serves a crucial role within the asset related methods, but that the marketplace itself is a pre-release product waiting to be released in Q4.

The marketplace currently only supports buying and selling using [MC tokens](/chain/get-started/gas).
Therefore, marketplace listings need to have their asking price denominated in MC, and profiles that want to buy assets need to be funded with MC as well.
You can [convert tokens](/service/assets/swapping-tokens) from and to MC though via the API, using the [decentralized exchange](/chain/beam-ecosystem/amm) on Beam.

### Roadmap

Throughout the coming months, we'll be releasing additional features that will help you to provide a more complete marketplace experience, with features ranging from programmatic offers, auctions and extensive filtering options to allow you to create a full-fledged in-game marketplace solely by relying on the Beam marketplace.
