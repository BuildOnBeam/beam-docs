# Marketplace

In order to get a marketplace going, we offer various methods that can help you get started with listing assets.
Keep in mind that the marketplace itself is a pre-release product waiting to be released in Q4.

In order to create a full marketplace integration it is important to understand all of the possibilities that you have.

- [Currencies](/service/marketplace/currencies): Supported currencies in Beam marketplace

- [Create a listing](/service/marketplace/listing-assets): Listing an asset for sale

- [Buying a listed item](/service/marketplace/buying-assets): Buying a listed asset through Sphere through the SDK

- [Offers](/service/marketplace/offers): Allow profiles to create offers on listed and unlisted assets

### Roadmap

Throughout the coming months, we'll be releasing additional features that will help you provide a more complete marketplace experience, with features ranging from programmatic offers, auctions and extensive filtering options to allow you to create a full-fledged in-game marketplace solely by relying on the Beam marketplace.
