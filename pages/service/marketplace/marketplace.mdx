# Marketplace

In order to get a marketplace going, we offer various methods that can help you get started with listing assets.
Keep in mind that our marketplace serves a crucial role within the asset related methods, but that the marketplace itself is a pre-release product waiting to be released in Q4.

The marketplace currently only supports buying and selling using [MC tokens](/chain/get-started/gas).
Therefore, marketplace listings need to have their asking price denominated in MC, and profiles that want to buy assets need to be funded with MC as well.
You can [convert tokens](/service/assets/swapping-tokens) from and to MC though via the API, using the [decentralized exchange](/chain/beam-ecosystem/amm) on Beam.

## Listing an asset

The first thing you probably want to do is to list an existing asset in a profile. In order to list an asset you need to pass us some information about the listing.

```typescript
const listingTransaction = await beam.assets.listAsset('your-seller-id', {
    assetId: "73",
    quantity: 1 // You can list multiple 1155 assets from the same token, defaults to 1
    price: '1000', // Listing price in Merit Circle token
    sellType: 'FixedPrice' // AscendingAuction, DescendingAuction or FixedPrice

    startTime: '', // auction start time, only needed with the AscendingAuction and DescendingAuction sell types
    endTime: '', // auction end time, only needed with the AscendingAuction and DescendingAuction sell types
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }
```

Different intricacies on the different selling types will be provided at a later date. To keep things simple, we advice to start listing with the 'FixedPrice' sell type only.

## Accessing listed items for your game

At the moment, we provide a method that allows you to retrieve all the listed items of a profile. Since we just listed an item, you can now verify whenever the item is actually for sale by calling the `getListedAssetsForProfile` method.

```typescript
const profileListings = await beam.assets.getListedAssetsForProfile(
  "your-seller-id",
  {
    offset: 0, // optional, defaults to 0
    limit: 10, // optional, defaults to 10
  }
);

// {
//   "data": [
//     {
//       "id": "string",
//       "price": "string",
//       "sellType": "string",
//       "startPrice": "string",
//       "endPrice": "string",
//       "platformFee": 0,
//       "royaltyFee": 0,
//       "currency": "string",
//       "startTime": "string",
//       "endTime": "string",
//       "quantityListed": 0,
//       "orderId": "string",
//       "expiresAt": "string",
//       "sellerAddress": "string",
//       "contractId": "string",
//       "nft": {
//         "id": "string",
//         "name": "string",
//         "imageUrl": "string",
//         "assetType": "string",
//         "assetAddress": "string",
//         "assetId": "string"
//       }
//     }
//   ],
//   "pagination": {
//     "count": 0,
//     "limit": 10,
//     "offset": 0
//   }
// }
```

## Buying a listed item

If a user shows interest in a listing for sale by another profile, it's possible to buy the listed asset with a profile by simply calling the `buyListedAsset` method. Note that in order to actually buy the asset, the buyer-profile needs to be funded with enough MC based on the listing price set by the seller profile.

```typescript
const profileListings = await beam.assets.buyListedAsset('your-buyer-id', {
    orderId: '' // data[0].orderId from the getListedAssetsForProfile method,
    quantity: 1 // the amount of NFTs to buy, only relevant for ERC-1155 based tokens, defaults to 1
});

// {
//   "status": "success",
//   "type": "custodial",
//   "transactionHash": '0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f',
//   "explorerUrl": "https://subnets.avax.network/beam/0x71f3f259568e9875c41a4350a3912a3a7650d9321ccd1d57641241128b4e504f"
// }

```

### Roadmap

Throughout the coming months, we'll be releasing additional features that will help you to provide a more complete marketplace experience, with features ranging from programmatic offers, auctions and extensive filtering options to allow you to create a full-fledged in-game marketplace solely by relying on the Beam marketplace.
