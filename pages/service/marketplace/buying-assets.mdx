## Buying a listed item

If a user shows interest in a listing for sale by another user, it's possible to buy the listed asset by simply calling the `buyListedAsset` method. Note that in order to actually buy the asset, the buyer-player account needs to be funded with enough BEAM based on the listing price set by the seller.

```typescript
const response = await beam.marketplaceV2.buyListedAssetV2('buyer-profile-id', 'order-id-to-fulfill' {
    quantity: 1 // the amount of NFTs to buy, only relevant for ERC-1155 based tokens, defaults to 1
});

// {
//   "status": "Pending",
//   "id": "string",
//   "createdAt": "2024-06-06T10:48:36.627Z",
//   "updatedAt": "2024-06-06T10:48:36.627Z",
//   "gameId": "string",
//   "userId": "string",
//   "chainId": 0,
//   "url": "string",
//   "transactions": [
//     (...)
//   ]
// }

```
