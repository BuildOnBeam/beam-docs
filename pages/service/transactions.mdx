# Transactions

Through Profiles, you were able to create a bunch of in-game accounts for your users and your own utility purposes. We've also explained how these in-game accounts can be funded with assets through minting - but before we dive into managing those assets within the profiles, it's good to have a general understanding about transactions.

Within the context of our sdk, a transaction is a transfer of assets of one profile to another - but since our underlying technology is blockchain, a transaction can also simply be explained as any on-chain transaction happening for your profiles (which are account abstractions)

### Transactions and gas

For every transaction that gets made on-chain, gas needs to be paid. Gas fee is the required to conduct transactions or execute contracts on a blockchain. The price of gas for required for a transaction is generally speaking very cheap, but could be increased based on network congestion.
