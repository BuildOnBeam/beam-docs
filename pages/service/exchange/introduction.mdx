# Introduction to the Exchnage

The API allows you to convert any in-game tokens or BEAM associated with a profile, using Beam's decentralized exchange swap.onbeam.com. Conversion rates are determined via an Automated Market Maker mechanism, and depend on supply and demand of the respective tokens. You can learn more about setting up a liquidity pool for your own tokens here, in order to enable trading.

### Roadmap

Throughout the coming months, we'll be releasing additional features that will help you to provide a more complete marketplace experience, with features ranging from programmatic offers, auctions and extensive filtering options to allow you to create a full-fledged in-game marketplace solely by relying on the Beam marketplace.
