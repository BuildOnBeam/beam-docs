# Introduction to the Exchange

The API allows you to convert any in-game tokens or BEAM associated with a profile, using Beam's decentralized exchange swap.onbeam.com. Conversion rates are determined via an Automated Market Maker mechanism, and depend on supply and demand of the respective tokens. You can learn more about setting up a liquidity pool for your own tokens here, in order to enable trading.
