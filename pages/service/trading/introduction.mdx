# Introduction to Trading

If you're building a trading based game that doesn't necessarily rely on buying and selling, Trading is for you.

### Roadmap

Throughout the coming months, we'll be releasing additional features that will help you provide a more complete marketplace experience, with features ranging from programmatic offers, auctions and extensive filtering options to allow you to create a full-fledged in-game marketplace solely by relying on the Beam marketplace.
