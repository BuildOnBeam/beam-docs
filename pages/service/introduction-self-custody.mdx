# Introduction to self-custody (beta)

Through our new self-custody implementation, you are able to set up self-custodial users with Beam. The implementation is a new service that works based on self-custodial private keys, and newly deployed account abstractions. Existing [Profiles](/service/profiles/introduction) that you created, won't be available in this new service.

### What is self custody?

Self-custody means that in this new implementation, a private key only controllable by the user can sign for transactions. The private key for each user is generated in the browser when they start interacting with [Sessions](/service/sessions/introduction) and [Operations](/service/operations/introduction).
When they do, they will be required to authorize with a social identity, from which a private key is generated and sharded - and securely stored.

### Disclaimer

Our self-custodial implementation is **subject to change**, while the basis of the implementation will remain more or less the same, we have different improvements in mind that will make the experience even better - for both you (the game developer) and the end user.
