# How to process Operations

After you created an Operation, the operation needs to be signed for. You could handle this in various ways, but we do recommend using our provided SDKs.


### Using our SDK

When using our SDK, processing an operation is as simple as providing the user entity id and the operation id. The `SignOperation` method will automatically open a browser or sign it with an existing Session.


```csharp
StartCoroutine(beamClient.CreateSession(
                "entityIdOfYourUser",
                actionResult =>
                {
                    if (actionResult.Status == BeamResultType.Success)
                    {
                        var session = actionResult.Result;
                        // you now have an active session that can sign operations
                    }
                },
                chainId: 13337, // optional chainId, defaults to 13337
                secondsTimeout: 240 // timeout in seconds for getting a result of Session signing from the browser
            ));
```


### Using the provided URL

As you might have seen when creating an Operation, we return a `url` property in the response. The `url` is a URL to our web interface, which the user can use in order to sign for the Operation.

Please note that if you use the web interface, we won't provide you with a proper callback about the status of the Operation. You will need to poll our APIs' [getOperation](https://api.testnet.onbeam.com/api/player#/Operation/getOperation) method periodically in order to know about status changes in the Operation based on user actions.

```csharp
//  {
//    "status": "Pending",
//    "id": "clwt0h7ej000c2jckyr2nh0cv",
//    "createdAt": "2024-05-30T08:46:42.620Z",
//    "updatedAt": null,
//    "gameId": "cltr8rde601aeakka28hbtuim",
//    "userId": "clwdehitt005biwog2szib1fh",
//    "chainId": 13337,
//    "url": "https://identity.testnet.onbeam.com/games/cltr8rde601aeakka28hbtuim/operation/clwt0h7ej000c2jckyr2nh0cv/confirm",
//    "game": {
//       ...
//    },
//    "transactions": [
//       ...
//    ]
//  }
```
