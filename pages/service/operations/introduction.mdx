# Introduction to Operations

Operations are the cornerstone of the self-custodial service in Beam. They facilitate the interaction between you and the end-user, who needs to sign for transactions.

Everything you do in the new self-custodial service that requires a signature, will return an Operation to be handled.

An Operation can consist out of **a single or multiple** transactions, as for some actions you would like to take - a user would need to provide multiple signatures. A good example of this situation would be interacting with the Marketplace: an Operation might consist out of a transaction to approve the Seaport contract required to interact with the marketplace, as well as the actual Seaport order to be signed by the user in order to get processed by the Marketplace.
