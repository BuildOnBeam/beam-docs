# Horizon

The Horizon upgrade is a transformative milestone for the Beam Network, marking its transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. This upgrade enhances the network's decentralization, scalability, and security, empowering users to actively participate in its validation and governance.

Key features of the Horizon upgrade include:
- **Introduction of Beam Nodes**: Enables users to secure the network by running or delegating to validators.
- **Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism**: Allows permissionless validation, making the network more accessible and efficient.
- **Node Token Integration**: Introduces an ERC-721 token as a key requirement for operating Beam Nodes.
- **Reward Distribution**: Validators and delegators can earn rewards, including transaction fees, protocol fees, and grants.

The Horizon upgrade sets the stage for a radically decentralized and user-driven ecosystem, ensuring Beam's evolution as a Layer 1 blockchain.
