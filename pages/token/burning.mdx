# Burning BEAM

BEAM can be destroyed through a process typically referred to as 'burning'. When BEAM is burned, it is sent to specific smart contracts resulting in the BEAM being permanently taken out of circulation. Burns result in a decrease in the circulating and maximum total supply of BEAM.

Beam protocols may be configured to direct part of the protocol fees to 'burn smart contracts'. More info about this will be published in connection with the [Horizon upgrade](/token/horizon). Additionally, anyone may at any time choose to burn all or some of their BEAM.
