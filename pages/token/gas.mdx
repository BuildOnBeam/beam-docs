# BEAM as a gas token fuelling Beam Network activity

Being the native gas token on the Beam Network, BEAM is the only acceptable form of payment for transaction fees on the Beam Network. To use the Beam Network, users need BEAM to interact with it (e.g. sending BEAM to another address or interacting with smart contracts on the Beam Network). In this way, BEAM functions as the fuel powering every transaction and the interaction with every application on the Beam Network, including every game built on top of it.
